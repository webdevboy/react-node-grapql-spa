      "description": "Although the ACJ318 is the smallest of the Airbus corporate jet family, it doesn&#39;t lack space. In fact, it is only the fuselage&#39;s length which has been shortened and the cabin maintains the impressive 3.7m width and 2.25m height of the larger ACJ319, 320 and 321. The benefits of this are countless, as, combined with such a spacious cabin, are the capacity to land at airports inaccessible to longer aircraft, London City for example, for which the ACJ318 is certified. The ACJ318&#39;s luxurious interior easily accommodates 18 passengers and the cabin is divided into 4 different sections, including lounge areas and a private room that doubles as an office and a comfortable bedroom. The extra fuel tanks on the aircraft extend its range to nearly 8000km, making it fully capable of intercontinental journeys. Launched in 2005 as the A318, before its rebranding in 2011, the ACJ318 is also the youngest of the Airbus corporate jet range and features the best of modern aviation technology. ",

It has an excellent operating range of just over 8000km, making it capable of crossing continents and oceans with ease and, like its sister aircraft, it can fly above weather at the 41,000ft cruise ceiling. In spite of its high performance, it is the interior of the ACJ320 which really separates it from its rivals. It allows for almost 100 square metres of cabin floor area, allowing for an infinite number of interior configurations. As an example, the interior might offer 5 separate living areas, including a master bedroom, lounge areas, another bedroom and a dining/conference room. Due to advanced noise reduction technology, the ACJ320 features an outstandingly quiet cabin, perfect for a ensuring a relaxing flight and that you arrive at your destination feeling rested. Overall, this aircraft successfully combines performance and luxury to provide an exceptional service. ",

Airbus had their first ACJ319 approved in 2002 as a VIP conversion of an extremely successful and reliable commercial airliner. The aircraft is particularly popular with heads of state due to, among other factors, the flexibility of the cabin thanks to a number of partitions enabling it to provide up to 6 separate zones. These zones accommodate up to 19 passengers and can contain bedrooms, dining areas and lounges depending on the individual aircraft&#39;s configuration, offering the height of comfort for your journey. In terms of performance, the ACJ319 is also an exceptional aircraft. It is capable of carrying out long-distance intercontinental flights of over 11000km in length and it completes these journeys at impressive cruise speeds, allowing you to complete longer flights in even better time. The ACJ319 is truly a top-of-the-range jet, perfectly suited to large parties wishing to undertake long journeys in optimum luxury and comfort. ",

Its long cabin is configured in a double Club 4 layout and can accommodate up to 8 passengers. Its baggage compartment is heated, pressurized and fully accessible in flight and additional baggage can be stored in its external lockers. As well as providing an extremely comfortable cabin, the King Air has been praised for its high performance and unmatched fuel efficiency, responsible for its low operating costs.

It was designed to replace the C90GTi and the addition of sleek winglets improves climb and cruise speed as well as boosting fuel efficiency and performance. Its range has been increased by more than 20%, taking you even further than before - that's 1,060nm at high speed with four adults on board. Although it is the smallest of the King Air range, it still comfortably accommodates up to 5 passengers. The cockpit features top-of-the-range turbulence detection and avionics systems, usually found on larger aircraft with even larger price tags. Adding to the appeal of this excellent Turboprop aircraft is its ability to land where many jets can't. Overall, this petite aircraft is packed with big jet features and offers an excellent range and fuel efficiency. ",

State-of-the art technology means that the BBJ can perform to this high standard, taking you on extensive trans-continental journeys, while maintaining a silent and steady cabin, allowing you to relax in serenity and comfort.

Known for its reliability, more than 300 of this aircraft, an upgrade of the Citation II, are still in operation. The Bravo features a comfortable interior, with a cabin length of 4.8m. In spite of not being the most recent aircraft, the Bravo comfortably seats up to 7 passengers in a Club 4 arrangement and 3 individual seats. In fact, many of the Bravos in operation today have been refurbished since rolling off the production line, optimizing their level of comfort. This aircraft also provides a good service, easily connecting major European cities in good time, as well as being certified for steep approach, giving it access to airports such as London City and Lugano. Overall, although this Light Jet may not be the most recent of the Cessna range, it is still capable of providing an excellent short-haul flight service.",

This is partly due to the CJ4's excellent interior, which, having been lengthened to 5.29m, is more spacious than all the other aircraft in the CJ range, comfortably accommodating up to 7 passengers. With a range of over 3700km and a top speed of 839kmh, the CJ4 is one of the highest performing Light Jets on the market. It is also offers great take off and landing capabilities, enabling it to access airports with short runways, such as Lugano or St Tropez, which are often more convenient. The state-of-the-art weather radar system allows it to detect potentially disruptive weather far in advance and, therefore, avoid turbulence, guaranteeing a smoother flight. The CJ4 provides an impressive service, getting you closer to your destination in great comfort and in excellent time. ",

With a range of over 5600km, the Citation X is capable of intercontinental travel, flying non-stop from Dubai to Nice, for example. This excellent performance stems from oversized twin-turbo Rolls-Royce engines and the aircraft's intelligent design features, such as the easily recognizable profiled wing and winglets. Stylish and modern, the Citation X's interior provides all the amenities you would expect to find inside a state-of-the-art corporate jet. Up to 8 passengers fit inside the spacious cabin which features two Club 4 seating arrangements to provide a comfortable journey. In this way, the Citation X matches its exceptional performance with an enjoyable and relaxing flight experience. ",

Since 2005, over 350 of these extremely popular jets have been produced and delivered to operators and Embraer and Honda have both reacted and launched competing VLJs. Although these are marginally larger than the Mustang, its cabin is still comfortable and seats 4 passengers. Furthermore, this aircraft offers excellent value for money, frequently being the most affordable jet on the market and often beating turbo-propeller aircraft in terms of price.

It features a more comfortable and modern interior, providing seating for up to 10 passengers, that serves to enhance the overall flight experience. The most important upgrade, besides cabin comfort, were the new twin-turbo fan engines that the EX was fitted with. These enable the EX to travel further and faster than its predecessor as well as helping it to reach a higher cruise altitude. This greatly reduces overall journey time, as the 2000EX is able to fly above commercial air traffic and take the most direct possible. This higher cruise altitude also meant that the EX was able to avoid potentially disruptive weather which helps ensure a smooth and comfortable journey. ",

The main difference between them is the exceptional low speed performance of the 2000S, which is responsible for it having the greenest footprint of Dassault's entire Falcon series. This low speed performance also reduces the 2000S' landing distance to 705 metres, meaning that this jet has access to 50% more airfields than other aircraft in its class, enabling it to get you to more remote landing strips that are often closer to your final destination.",

It represents the pinnacle of the Falcon series of aircraft, as it is both the fastest and also offers the greatest range of over 11,000km. Its high performance is partly due to the three ultra-modern turbo fan engines, which power the 7X, as well as the intelligent, streamlined design of the aircraft. This external design not only increases the jet&#39;s efficiency, but, also increases comfort inside the cabin, as sleek winglets and horizontal stabilisers ensure that your flight will be smooth and relaxing. This long range jet also features an accommodating cabin which seats up to 14 passengers in maximum comfort and excellent in-flight technology to make your flight is entertaining and enjoyable. All things considered, the 7X is luxurious and efficient and provides a great service. ",

This new flagship of the Falcon range, like the 7X, is categorised as a Long Range Jet and excels in every department to truly define itself as a top-of-the-range aircraft. Engine improvements, aerodynamic refinements and an increase in fuel capacity give the 8X incredible range, considerably greater than the 7X, and even better than Bombardier's Global 6000. This will allow the Falcon 8X to complete flights as far as Paris to Singapore and New York to Beijing, and it will do so at a high cruise speed, getting you to your destination in excellent time. The aircraft is fitted with state-of-the-art technology, providing it with impressive fuel efficiency, as well as weather detection and stabilisation systems to ensure a smooth journey. The spacious cabin is longer than that of the Falcon 7X, giving up to 15 passengers an even more comfortable and enjoyable flight in one of its wide variety of available seating configurations. Dassault have not compromised in the production of the Falcon 8X, resulting in a Long Range Jet whose extremely high performance is matched by its optimised interior. ",

There are many adaptations of this aircraft: the 900, 900B and 900C being older versions, the 900EX being an older long-range version and the 900LX being the most recent long-range version. The DX, although categorised as Super Large, as opposed to Long Range, can still easily fly from Paris to Chicago non-stop and can maintain an impressive cruise speed of 878kmh. It features an excellent interior which is divided into three distinct areas, seating up to 13 passengers in a day configuration and sleeping up to 7 in comfortable beds. It is also fully-equipped with all the amenities you would expect to find on-board a top-of-the-range jet, including a full front galley. ",

These improvements, combined with the recognizable and effective profiled winglets, also explain the maximum cruise speed of the Falcon 900LX, which is greater than both the Bombardier Challenger 850 and the Global 5000. Much like the 900DX, this aircraft is categorised as a Super Large Business Jet and offers the same extra-wide and long fuselage, similar in size to that of the flagship Falcon 7X.

The cabin is more spacious than that of many Large and some Super Large Jets and, at over 2 metres high, is taller than that of Embraer&#39;s Lineage 1000 VIP Airliner. It will also feature a stylish modern interior, including the first ever skylight ceiling window to appear in a corporate jet, as well as a state-of-the-art entertainment system and stabilisation technology to ensure a smooth and enjoyable flight. Up to 14 passengers will be able to travel in this luxurious aircraft, which also promises impressive performance, offering class-leading range and cruise speed that rival and, in fact, often surpass those of even Super Large Jets. Due to the combination of incredible spaciousness, performance and design, the Falcon 5X is one of the most eagerly anticipated Business Jets on the horizon and, if it lives up to expectations and fulfills Dassault&#39;s promises, is destined to set the benchmark for top-of-the-range private jet travel.

Being a jet aircraft, the ERJ 145 cruises at a considerably greater speed than Turboprop Airliners, like the Fokker 50 for example, and offers a much more quiet journey and a longer range. Overall, this aircraft provides an excellent service for large groups looking for an efficient and comfortable means of private transportation. ",

It offers the greatest range of any business jet in its class, capable of connecting New York and Dubai, for example. With an incredible maximum cruise speed, the G650 is also the fastest long range jet on the market and is powered by two of Rolls-Royce's outstanding and efficient BR725 engines. It, therefore, flies faster and further than any other jet in its category and, with its ultra-large cabin, does so with the utmost comfort too. It easily accommodates up to 13 passengers in luxurious recliners and sofas, which are divided between three separate seating areas. The G650 also features the latest technology to provide entertainment as well as high performance and the latest turbulence detection and noise reduction systems ensure a silent, steady and relaxing cabin. Like in the G550, Gulfstream have succeeded in reducing passenger travel fatigue by the implementation of a 100% fresh air system and a maximum cabin altitude of 6,000ft. ",

The GV is also known for its reliability and Gulfstream&rsquo;s most recent flagship aircraft, the G550 and G650, the pinnacle of ultra-high performance business jets, are modelled on its design. The GV&rsquo;s cabin is quiet, spacious and comfortable and usually caters for 14 passengers, although it can accommodate up to 19 in certain configurations.

It is also still capable of travelling impressive distances, easily connecting Moscow with New York or London with Dubai, and does so at high speed. This is largely due to the G500's optimized wing design and turbo fan which enable it to fly faster and higher than any commercial aircraft, keeping it clear of commercial air traffic and above adverse weather conditions. The large, 3-zone cabin sits up to 14 passengers in a day configuration or up to 7 passengers in a night configuration. It is equipped with an aft lavatory, pressurized baggage compartment, which is accessible during the flight, and a fully-equipped front galley. The cabin is also fitted with the latest entertainment technology, including WIFI connection to ensure an enjoyable journey. ",

Name aside, this Super Midsize jet has captured global attention since its launch in 2012 for its incredible performance. It has an excellent range of over 6600km, further than its Cessna, Bombardier and Hawker rivals and is extremely fast, having set a number of new city-pairing records. Gulfstream believe that it also has the best fuel efficiency in its category and challenge anyone to find a more comfortable cabin. The interior of the G280 is not only larger and more spacious than its competitors, accommodating up to 9 passengers in a Club 4 formation, three-seater sofa and two additional seats, but it also offers state-of-the-art technology to create a silent cabin environment.

The Premier 1A's most astounding feature is its spacious cabin, which is not only taller and wider than all its Cessna competitors but also than any other aircraft in its class. Although, the Premier 1A is categorised as a Light Jet, the cabin width and height is, in fact, greater than that of some Super Light Jets, the Learjet 45XR for example. Consequently, the Premier 1A is an extremely spacious jet and easily accommodates up to 6 passengers in a Club 4 seating arrangement and an additional 2 individual seats. The exceptional interior of this aircraft is largely due to its unique composite fuselage, which is also responsible for enabling the Premier 1A to offer decent range and a good maximum cruising speed. This combination of performance and comfort makes the Premier 1A an extremely popular aircraft and a great option for short-haul flights. ",

The result was impressive as the 850XP offers a great range and top speed as well as being highly efficient. The aircraft's success is also down to its exceptional interior. The cabin is longer and wider than many of its competitors in the category of Midsize Jets, including the Gulfstream G150 and the Cessna Citation Sovereign. The 850XP is, therefore, extremely spacious and easily seats up to 8 passengers in ultimate comfort. All things considered, in the 850XP, Hawker Beechcraft have succeeded in creating an aircraft which represents an excellent option for medium-haul journeys as it provides an efficient and comfortable service.

The spacious cabin caters for up to 8 passengers to travel in the utmost comfort and is equipped with a front galley to provide a great dining service. It features the same eye-catching design as the 850XP, in the form of sleek winglets and a highly swept tailfin, while performance enhancing upgrades enable the 900XP to better its predecessor in terms of range and maximum cruising speed. The cabin is also quieter, leading to a more enjoyable and relaxing journey.",

It, therefore, offers an inferior range to other, larger, members of the Hawker family, while still being extremely competitive in its category, capable of completing longer uninterrupted flights than both the Citation XLS+ and the Learjet 45XR. It also offers a comfortable stand-up cabin, considerably more spacious than that of the Learjet 45XR, which easily caters for up to 8 passengers. The Hawker 750 provides a balance of impressive performance and a high quality interior, resulting in an excellent Super Light Jet.",

In fact, its speed and range are so great that they rival those of some light jets and its fuel efficiencies are nearly 40% greater than most business jets. The interior, seating 7 passengers, also resembles a jet from a different, more expensive category as its quiet cabin and is wider and taller than any of the Cessna CJ range.

It will also be capable of impressive range, similar to that of the Phenom 300 and the CJ4.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn top of high performance, the PC-24 promises to provide the interior space and comfort of a Midsize Jet for the price of a Light Jet. It will feature the longest and widest cabin of any aircraft in its category, as well as offering the greatest amount of luggage space that will be accessible through its large cargo door.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith many orders already being placed for the PC-24, it is clear that Pilatus have succeeded in convincing the industry that their newest Light Jet offering will provide passengers with a perfect balance of performance and comfort.

      "description": "Saab began production of the 340 in partnership with Fairchild Aircraft in 1983 and the aircraft quickly became a popular Turboprop Airliner, used by a wide variety of different civil operators and commercial airlines. The Saab 340 offers similar performance capabilities as the Dornier 328 Turboprop and is also of a similar size, seating up to 33 passengers in an economy configuration, although variations to this formation exist, with some aircraft having 34 or 36 seats. Being a turbo-propeller powered aircraft, the Saab 340 has limited range, restricting it to short-haul flights. With a large capacity and excellent price, the Saab 340 represents a great solution to short-haul journey requirements. ",

Par exemple, l'aménagement en 5 zones distinctes est envisageable, composée d'un chambre principale, de vastes salons, d'un seconde chambre et d'une salle-à-manger/salle de conférence.

Lancé en 2004, il s’agit d’une version améliorée du modèle Learjet 40, auquel un moteur à la puissance nettement accrue a été ajouté. Grâce à ces améliorations, le 40XR offre une vitesse ascensionnelle plus élevée qui lui permet de voler au-dessus du trafic aérien commercial très rapidement. Sa portée est également très impressionnante, bien plus importante que celle du Citation CJ2+ ou encore du Hawker 400XP. Par ailleurs, il présente la vitesse de croisière maximale la plus élevée de sa catégorie, surpassant même le très puissant Phenom 300. Outre cette vitesse exceptionnelle, le Learjet 40XR est également très spacieux : il accueille jusqu’à 6 passagers au sein d’une cabine au confort d’exception, qui s’avère la plus longue cabine de la catégorie des jets légers. Cet avion offre sans aucun doute l’équilibre parfait entre performances et confort et représente par conséquent la solution idéale pour les vols court-courriers.",

L'objectif était de proposer une cabine aux dimensions d'un jet gros porteur au prix d'un avion d'affaires super intermédiaire. Le Challenger 300 propose une cabine très spacieuse, oè l'on se tient debout. Elle est mème plus grande que celles de la concurrence de la catégorie super intermédiaire, ce qui en fait un excellent produit du point de vue économique. Avec son aménagement classique en club-4, sofa 3 places et 2 sièges individuels, l'appareil accueille jusqu'à 9 passagers qui profitent du plus grand confort. De plus, le 300 qui affiche des performances élevées est un produit qui propose un excellent service. Avec un distance franchissable des plus compétitives (plus de 5 700 km), l'avion peut aisément rallier Cannes à Duba´, par exemple. Parce qu'il est près spacieux et très fiable, le Challenger 300 répond particulièrement aux besoins de vols moyen-courrier. ",

Sa cabine extrèmement spacieuse accueille aisément jusqu'à 8 passagers qui prennent place dans les 6 sièges individuels et le sofa deux-places installé à l'avant de l'espace intérieur. Le XLS+ atteint une vitesse de croisière élevée et l'appareil est certifié pour atterrir sur des pistes courtes, inaccessible aux avions plus gros. En outre, ces aéroports sont mème plus proches de votre site de destination finale. Performance, confort et vol direct ! Le dernier modèle de la famille Excel du constructeur Cessna convient parfaitement pour des vols court-courrier, notamment pour rallier les villes européennes en voyage d'affaires ou le temps d'un week-end.

En second lieu, le LX dispose de nouvelles ailes particulières à la marque dont la conception vise à réduire la trainée, jusqu'à 5 % en moins. Une telle spécificité en fait l'appareil le plus performant de la famille des Flacon et surtout le place parmi les premiers des avions d'affaires lourds. En troisième lieu, étant très récent, le LX dispose d'une cabine encore mieux équipée, puisqu'elle est dotée des systèmes de divertissement de bord de dernière génération, qu'elle bénéficie de la technologie de réduction du bruit, en outre la disposition des sièges rend l'appareil particulièrement confortable pour ses 10 passagers (max.).

Tout comme le LX, le 2000S dispose d'un cabine spacieuse oè l'on se tient debout, son aménagement est confortable et les passagers, jusqu'à 10, sont installés en configuration club-4 et 6 sièges individuels. La grande différence entre les deux avions tient à l'exceptionnelle performance à basse vitesse du 2000S, ce qui se traduit par la meilleure empreinte écologique des avions de la famille Falcon du constructeur Dassault. Avec cette performance à basse vitesse, le 2000S peut prétendre à réduire sa distance d'atterrissage de 700 m. Dès lors, à la différence de ces concurrents, il a la capacité d'atterrir sur 50 % des aéroports. Les pistes les moins faciles sont à sa portée, quant aux passagers, ils sont plus proches de votre destination finale ! Si le 2000S est proche du LX, ce dernier point fait toute la différence mettant le 2000S à part dans la famille des Falcon et mème dans cette catégorie d'aéronefs. ",

Ses superbes performances reposent en partie sur les trois turboréacteurs ultra modernes qui équipent l'appareil et aussi sur sa conception inventive et sa ligne aérodynamique. Bien entendu son profilage améliore son efficacité, de plus il accroit le confort intérieur de l'avion, puisque la présence des winglets profilées et des stabilisateurs horizontaux sont autant de garants pour un vol paisible et reposant. L'aménagement de la cabine de ce jet long-courrier qui peut accueillir jusqu'à 14 passagers est un gage de confort maximal et l'installation d'équipements intérieurs fera de ce vol un moment fort agréable. En résumé, le 7X est un jet luxueux, performant et confortable. ",

Les performances améliorées des moteurs, la finesse aérodynamique et la plus grande capacité en carburant permettent au 8X de bénéficier d’un rayon d’action exceptionnel, bien plus long que celui du modèle 7X, et même supérieur à celui du Global 6000 de Bombardier. Ainsi, le Falcon 8X sera en mesure d’assurer des vols reliant Paris à Singapour ou New York à Pékin et ce, à une vitesse de croisière extrêmement élevée, vous garantissant d’arriver à destination en temps et en heure. Cet avion est un véritable bijou de technologie de pointe. Il offre alors un rendement en carburant incroyable et intègre des systèmes de stabilisation et de détection des conditions climatiques garantissant un voyage sans encombre. La cabine spacieuse est plus longue que celle du Falcon 7X et assure un vol encore plus plaisant et confortable aux 15 passagers (au maximum) qui pourront choisir parmi l’éventail de configurations mises à leur disposition pour l’aménagement des sièges. Dassault n’a accepté aucun compromis quant à la production du Falcon 8X. En résulte un jet à très long rayon d’action, dont les performances hors norme vont de pair avec son intérieur sublimé.",

La cabine est plus spacieuse que celle de nombreux jets de grande et très grande capacité et, avec une hauteur sous plafond de près de 2 mètres, elle devance celle de l’appareil VIP d’Embraer, le Lineage 1000. Ce modèle sera par ailleurs pourvu d’un intérieur des plus modernes et élégants et sera le tout premier jet d’affaires à intégrer un puits de lumière au plafond. Il sera également équipé d’un système de divertissement ultra-perfectionné et de la technologie de stabilisation, garantissant un vol agréable et tout en douceur. Cet écrin de luxe sera en mesure d’accueillir jusqu’à 14 passagers à son bord et promet des performances impressionnantes : un rayon d’action parmi les plus longs et une vitesse de croisière semblable, voire même supérieure, à celle de certains jets de très grande capacité. Alliance parfaite d’espace, de performances et de design, le Falcon 5X figure parmi les jets d’affaires les plus attendus du moment et, s’il est à la hauteur des attentes et tient les promesses de Dassault, deviendra certainement une référence sur le segment des jets privés haut de gamme.",

Cet aéronef est l'un des moins gourmands en kérosène au monde, avec une consommation d'à peine 59 gallons (950 litres) l'heure. Ceci justifie son faible coét d'exploitation et partant son prix extrèmement compétitif. Or, l'Eclipse 550 ne sacrifie aucunement ses performances pour atteindre une consommation de carburant aussi basse, en effet sa vitesse de croisière maximale et sa distance franchissable de plus de 2 000 km, en font un moyen de transport pratique pour rallier les principales ville d'Europe.

Sa vaste cabine intérieure répond aux exigences d'un espace VIP. En effet, celle-ci est plus spacieuse que chez ses concurrents Dassault ou Bombardier. L'aménagement en trois zones facilite grandement le service de restauration pour les 13 passagers, qui jouissent d'un confort maximal. La soute à bagages du 600 est le plus vaste dans cette catégorie d'avion ; de plus, il est accessible depuis la cabine centrale. L'appareil est certifié pour les approches à forte pente, il peut donc atterrir sur des pistes inaccessibles à de nombreux autres avions. L'intérieur somptueusement  équipé fait du Legacy 600 un appareil extrèmement apprécié au sein de la gamme des avions d'affaires lourds. Cet avion répond tout à fait au besoin des vols moyen-courrier. ",

Pour conclure, l’intérieur spacieux et les performances que propose ce modèle le rendent très attrayant aux yeux des passagers effectuant des trajets court-courriers en groupes importants.",

Les hublots arborent la signature Gulfstream et éclairent l'intérieur de la cabine qui accueille jusqu'à 12 passagers, ou peut aussi ètre en configuration allée centrale. Une zone de basse pression équipe le G350 afin de réduire la fatigue du voyage des passagers qui arrivent alors à destination plus reposés.

Ce modèle de la famille des Gulfstream affiche de très belles performances, extrèmement rapide et affichant une distance franchissable des plus intéressantes. Par exemple, le G450 peut rallier Genève à New York en vol direct, d'ailleurs il effectue de telles liaisons plus rapidement qu'un jet privé gros porteurs moyen. La cabine est silencieuse et calme alors mème que l'appareil doté d'un puissant moteur vole à vive allure. La cabine spacieuse accueille jusqu'à 13 passagers en trois zones distinctes, et l'office situé à l'arrière de l'appareil permet d'assurer le service de restauration à bord. En résumé, avec son G450, Gulfstream a su allier performance et luxe pour que vous bénéficiez d'un trajet rapide et confortable. ",

Il est plus petit que le modèle Hawker 4000, issu de la même catégorie, mais s’avère plus grand que le Cessna Citation X et le Dassault Falcon 50EX, accueillant jusqu’à 9 passagers dans le plus grand des conforts. Il présente un rayon d’action semblable à celui du Challenger 300, qui, bien qu’inférieur à celui du G280 par exemple, lui permet tout de même d’assurer des liaisons intercontinentales. Le Hawker 1000 offre des performances et un confort de cabine tout à fait honorables et s’avère d’une fiabilité exemplaire. En outre, cet avion est très souvent une excellente alternative puisqu’il est fréquemment proposé à un prix nettement plus abordable que la plupart des autres jets de type « Super Midsize », et plus particulièrement ses concurrents Gulfstream et Dassault.

Ses performances en altitude élevée liée à sa distance franchissable supérieure à 6 000 km sont très appréciées, alors qu'il vole à une vitesse de croisière maximale de près de 900 km/h. De fait,  il permet à ses passagers de parcourir rapidement de longues distances. L'intérieur de l'appareil est spacieux et bien aménagé, 7 hublots sont disposés de part et d'autre de la cabine qui accueille jusqu'à 8 passagers en configuration double club-4 classique. L'avion dispose aussi d'une soute à bagages pressurisée accessible en vol. En résumé, ce jet super intermédiaire confortable et performant est extrèmement prisé et constitue un excellent choix. ",

Il n'est pas que l'élégance de l'Avanti qui retienne l'attention, ses très belles performances, sa capacité à couvrir des distances toujours plus longues et à voler plus vite lui confèrent une place à part dans son segment. En fait, sa vitesse et sa distance franchissable sont telles qu'il peut concurrencer certains jets privés légers, en outre sa consommation de kérosène est inférieure de près de 40 % à la plupart des avions d'affaires. L'intérieur de l'Avanti II rappelle le raffinement des cabines des avions de catégorie nettement plus onéreuse, tandis que les dimensions et la quiétude de l'espace passagers rivalisent avec les CJ de chez Cessna. L'alliance du confort et des performances, inédite pour un appareil de cette catégorie, contribue à faire de l'Avanti II un produit économiquement remarquable. ",

Cette dernière vertu lui ouvrant l’accès à quelques 21,000 pistes que la grande majorité des autres jets ne peuvent utiliser (l’utilisation de pistes non-revêtues n’est possible qu’en opération privée et non en charter du fait de la règlementation commerciale). Cet appareil aura un rayon d’action de près de 2000 nm similaire à celui du Phenom 300 ou du Citation CJ4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEn plus de ses hautes performances, le PC-24 promet un espace intérieur confortable, semblable à la gamme “Midsize”, pour le prix d’un “light jet”.

Роскошный салон ACJ318 может легко вместить 18 пассажиров и разделен на 4 отдельных зоны, включая гостиные зоны и частную комнату, которая может выступать в качестве офиса и комфортабельной спальни.

После серии модернизаций за многие годы модель King Air 90 GTx была запущена в июле 2009 года. Она была спроектирована для замены модели C90GTi, и добавление гладких КАП крыла повысило скорость набора высоты и крейсерскую скорость, а также снизило расход топлива и улучшило летные характеристики. Дальность полета возросла более чем на 20%, доставляя Вас еще дальше, чем раньше - 1060 морских миль при высокой скорости с четырьмя взрослыми на борту. Хотя это самая мелкая модель в линейке King Air, она все равно с комфортом может принять до 5 пассажиров. Кокпит оснащен лучшими системами обнаружения зон турбулентности и авиационными системами, обычно представленными на более крупных самолетах с еще большей ценой. Имидж этого отличного турбовинтового самолета дополняет его способность садиться там, где многие реактивные самолеты не могут.

С Global 8000 компания Bombardier обещает представить самолет, который сможет летать дальше не только по сравнению с остальным воздушным флотом компании, но и по сравнению с любым другим существующим дальнемагистральным деловым реактивным самолетом. То есть этот реактивный самолет сможет перевозить до 13 пассажиров из Лос-Анджелеса в Сидней или из Гонконга в Нью-Йорк. Однако Global 8000 камня на камне не оставит от конкурентов не только за счет неповторимой дальности полета, но и за счет невероятно роскошного салона, обеспечивающего любому пассажиру приятную поездку, спят ли они в одной из комфортабельных кроватях, смотрят ли фильм перед огромным экраном или глядят в огромные окна самолета. Двигатели следующего поколения не только обеспечивают тишину в салоне, но и высокую экономичность, сжигая меньше топлива при меньших выбросах, чем когда-либо раньше.",

      "description": "Модель CJ1 была запущена в 1998 году, как модернизированный вариант модели CitationJet и производилась до 2006 года, когда на рынке появилась усовершенствованная версия с различными улучшениями: CJ1+. Эти усовершенствования заключались в повышенных летных характеристиках, ощутимом увеличении максимальной крейсерской скорости, вертикальной скорости набора высоты и взлетных возможностях. Хотя он имеет самую небольшую кабину во всей линейке легких деловых реактивных самолетов Cessna, он все равно остается существенно просторнее, чем Mustang, сверхлегкого реактивного самолета Cessna, и рассчитан на комфортное размещение 5 пассажиров в конфигурации Club 4 и на дополнительном кресле перед дверью. Способные совершать беспосадочный полет длительностью до 3 часов и доступные по отличной цене, модели CJ1 и CJ1+ являются отличными вариантами для внутриевропейских путешествий, например, для деловых поездок или отдыха в выходные.

С кабиной, увеличенной почти на метр по сравнению с CJ1, эти самолеты могут принять на борт до 6 пассажиров с отличным комфортом, обычно в конфигурации Club 4 и на 2 индивидуальных креслах. Кроме того, имеется большое пространство для туалета и небольшой бортовой кухни впереди. Модель CJ2+ обладает большей максимальной крейсерской скоростью, чем оба ее предшественника и CJ1+, а также увеличенной дальностью полета. Этот легкий реактивный самолет крайне популярен на рейсах между европейскими городами, например, между Лондоном и Римом, за счет его высоких летных характеристик и отличного соотношения цена-качество.

Кроме того, имеется небольшое кресло перед дверью, пригодное для ребенка. В дополнение к улучшенному салону CJ3 также обладает модернизированным двигателем и увеличенными крыльями, обеспечивая более высокую максимальную крейсерскую скорость, большую дальность полета и повышенную экономичность по сравнению с CJ2+.

Это самая новая и большая модель в семействе CJ, стремительно набравшая популярность, особенно в Европе. Отчасти это связано с великолепным салоном CJ4 длиной до 5,29 м, что делает его более просторным по сравнению со всеми остальными самолетами в линейке CJ, комфортно размещая 7 пассажиров. Обладая дальностью полета выше 3700 км и максимальной скоростью 839 км/ч, CJ4 - один из самых мощных легких реактивных самолетов на рынке. Кроме того, он обладает отличными взлетно-посадочными возможностями, обеспечивая доступ в аэропорты с короткими взлетно-посадочными полосами, таким как Лугано или Сан-Тропе, которые часто являются более удобными. Современная метеорологическая радарная система обеспечивает обнаружение потенциально неблагоприятных погодных условий с большим запасом времени и, тем самым, позволяет избегать турбулентности, гарантируя более плавный полет. CJ4 предоставляет впечатляющий уровень обслуживания, приближая вас к пункту назначения с комфортом и быстро. ",

Модель Citation XLS+ обладает лучшей дальностью полета среди всей серии Excel супер-легких самолетов, позволяя совершать беспосадочный полет свыше 3500 км. Она также имеет очень просторную кабину, которая легко вмещает 8 пассажиров в 6 отдельных креслах и на дополнительном двухместном диване впереди. XLS+ также летает на высокой скорости и сертифицирован для посадки на более коротких летных полях, недоступных более крупным самолетам и зачастую ближе к вашему конечному пункту назначения. Экономичный, комфортабельный и прямой; последняя модель самолета компании Cessna серии Excel идеально подходит для коротких путешествий и, в частности, отлично подходит для внутриевропейских деловых полетов или отдыха в выходные.

Несмотря на то, что это звание принадлежит сейчас Gulfstream G650, модель Citation X все еще очень быстра, гораздо быстрее любого другого самолета в этой категории супер-среднеразмерных самолетов. Обладая дальностью полета более 5600 км, Citation X способна совершать межконтинентальные рейсы, без посадки, между Дубаем и Ниццей, например. Эти отличные летные характеристики обусловлены крупногабаритными двигателями с двойным турбонаддувом Rolls-Royce и интеллектуальными свойствами конструкции, например, легко распознаваемыми профилированными крыльями и КАП крыла. Стильный и современный, салон Citation X предоставляет все удобства, которые вы ожидаете увидеть внутри современного корпоративного реактивного самолета. До 8 пассажиров размещаются внутри просторной кабины с двумя компоновками кресел Club 4, обеспечивая комфортное путешествие. Таким образом, Citation X соответствует своим исключительным летным характеристикам, способствуя приятному и расслабляющему полету. ",

Компания Cessna считает, что заполнила брешь в отрасли частных чартеров благодаря успеху модели Mustang. С 2005 года было произведено и доставлено покупателям свыше 350 штук этих очень популярных реактивных самолетов, а компании Embraer и Honda среагировали и выпустили конкурирующие VLJ. Несмотря на то, что они существенно больше модели Mustang, его кабина с комфортом вмещает 4 пассажира. Кроме того, этот самолет имеет отличное соотношение цена-качество, зачастую оказываясь самым доступным реактивным самолетом на рынке и побеждая турбовинтовые самолеты в отношении цены. Учитывая все сказанное, Mustang прекрасно подходит для внутриевропейских полетов, деловых полетов одного дня и экскурсий в выходные. ",

Эту модель отличает более комфортабельный и современный салон, рассчитанный на 10 пассажиров и улучшающий общее ощущение от полета. Самой важной модернизацией, помимо комфорта в кабине, стали новые двигатели с двойным турбонаддувом, которыми была оснащена модель EX. Благодаря им модель EX может передвигаться дальше и быстрее, чем ее предшественник, а также обладает большей крейсерской высотой. Это существенно сокращает общее время в пути, т.к. модель 2000EX способна лететь над маршрутами коммерческих воздушных судов, и максимально спрямлять путь. Более высокая крейсерская высота означает также способность EX избегать потенциально неблагоприятной погоды, что обеспечивает более плавное и комфортное путешествие. ",

Во-вторых, LX имеет совершенно новые крылья, конструкция которых снижает лобовое сопротивление на 5%, еще больше снижая расход топлива по сравнению с предшественником, и, на самом деле, с любым другим самолетом категории больших реактивных самолетов. В третьих, статус самого нового самолета означает наличие у LX гораздо более современного салона, оснащенного современной развлекательной системой, технологией шумоизоляции и более комфортабельными креслами для 10 пассажиров. Учитывая все, можно сказать, что компания Dassault модернизировала все зоны модели 2000EX, чтобы создать Falcon 2000LX, крайне экономичный и комфортабельный корпоративный реактивный самолет, обеспечивающий исключительное обслуживание, будь то путешествие по делам или ради удовольствия.

Как и LX, модель 2000S имеет просторную, прочную кабину, с комфортом вмещающую до 10 пассажиров в конфигурации Club 4 и на 6 отдельных креслах.

      "description": "Первая партия Dassault 8X, давно ожидаемой новейшей версии самолета семейства Falcon, ожидается в конце 2016 года. Этот новый флагман линейки Falcon, как и 7X, относится к категории дальнемагистральных реактивных самолетов и великолепен во всех аспектах, чтобы стать настоящим флагманом. Усовершенствования двигателя, аэродинамические улучшения и увеличение запаса топлива обеспечивают 8X невероятную дальность полета, существенно больше, чем у модели 7X, и даже лучше, чем у модели Global 6000 компании Bombardier. Благодаря этому Falcon 8X может совершать полеты из Парижа в Сингапур и из Нью-Йорка в Пекин, с высокой крейсерской скоростью и за короткое время. Самолет оснащен современными технологиями, обеспечивающими впечатляющую топливную экономичность, а также метеорологическими и стабилизационными системами для плавного путешествия. Просторная кабина длиннее кабины Falcon 7X, вмещая до 15 пассажиров с еще большим комфортом в полете за счет одной из многочисленных возможных компоновок кресел. Компания Dassault не шла на компромиссы при производстве Falcon 8X, в результате чего появился дальнемагистральный реактивный самолет, чья крайне высокая производительность полностью соответствует оптимизированному салону.

Она была запущена в 2005 года и использует те же крылья, что и ее предшественники, но обладает более широким и длинным фюзеляжем и кабиной одинакового размера с Falcon 7X, флагманом линейки Falcon компании Dassault. Существует много вариантов этого самолета: 900, 900B и 900C - более старые версии, 900EX - более старая дальнемагистральная версия и 900LX - самая последняя дальнемагистральная версия. Модель DX, несмотря на то, что относится к категории супер-больших самолетов, в отличие от дальнемагистральных, может легко совершать полеты из Парижа в Чикаго и поддерживать впечатляющую крейсерскую скорость 878 км/ч. Она обладает отличным салоном, разделенным на три отдельных зоны, вместимостью до 13 пассажиров и 7 комфортабельными кроватями. Этот самолет также хорошо оснащен всеми удобствами, которые вы ожидаете увидеть на борту флагманского реактивного самолета, включая полностью оборудованную переднюю кухню. ",

      "description": "Компания Dassault поставила первый самолет Falcon 900LX в 2010 году в качестве замены модели 900EX. Он имеет различные улучшения, включая новые крылья и три новых турбовентиляторных двигателя, которые повышают общую производительность, в частности в отношении расхода топлива и дальности полета, которая составляет 8800 км. Эти улучшения, в сочетании с отличительными и эффективными профилированными КАП крыла, также обеспечивают максимальную крейсерскую скорость Falcon 900LX выше, чем у обеих моделей компании Bombardier: Challenger 850 и Global 5000. Очень похожий на 900DX, этот самолет относится к категории супер-больших деловых реактивных самолетов и обладает тем же очень широким фюзеляжем, схожим по размеру с флагманом Falcon 7X. Современный салон разделен на три отдельные зоны и вмещает до 13 пассажиров, причем он не просто просторный, но и роскошный, имеет WIFI и MP3-систему для обеспечения приятного путешествия. Комфортабельный, экономичный и способный совершать перелеты между основными городами, такими как Париж и Пекин или Нью-Йорк и Москва, Falcon 900LX - фантастический вариант для вашего полета.",

Несмотря на то, что он относится к категории супер-среднеразмерных реактивных самолетов, Falcon 5X превосходит обычные ожидания от самолета этой категории по всем аспектам. Кабина является более просторной, чем у многих больших и некоторых супер-больших реактивных самолетов и, будучи свыше 2 метров в высоту, выше, чем у VIP-авиалайнера в линейке Lineage 1000 компании Embraer. Она также имеет стильный современный салон, включая первое в мире потолочное окно на корпоративном реактивном самолете, а также современную развлекательную систему и стабилизационную технологию для плавного и приятного полета. До 14 пассажиров смогут путешествовать в этом роскошном самолете, который также обладает впечатляющими летными характеристиками, ведущей в классе дальностью полета и крейсерской скоростью, и зачастую превосходит эти параметры даже супер-больших реактивных самолетов. Благодаря сочетанию невероятного простора, летных характеристик и дизайна модель Falcon 5X является одной из самых ожидаемых среди деловых реактивных самолетов и, если она удовлетворит ожиданиям, и обещания компании Dassault будут выполнены, станет примером среди флагманов частных реактивных самолетов.

Модель 50EX это не только стиль и мощь, т.к. предлагает возможность использовать короткие поля, приличную дальность полета и максимальную крейсерскую скорость. Несмотря на самую короткую кабину в линейке частных реактивных самолетов компании Dassault, 50EX с комфортом вмещает до 9 пассажиров.

      "description": "Модель Dornier 328 Turboprop - это вариант самолета серии 328 компании Dornier 328, в которой также представлены Dornier 328JET и Dornier 328. Как следует из названия, эта версия принадлежит к категории турбовинтовых авиалайнеров и поэтому не имеет такой большой дальности полета, как другие представители семейства 328, хотя может совершать беспосадочные полеты почти на 2000 км. Она существенно больше Dornier 228 Turboprop Airliner и вмещает до 32 пассажиров в стандартной компоновке кресел. Этот самолет очень надежен и доступен, а также благодаря практичности прекрасно подходит для больших групп, собирающихся в частный полет на короткое расстояние. ",

С самого начала она была спроектирована для предложения лучшего соотношения цена-качество на рынке корпоративных деловых реактивных самолетов, сохраняя приличный комфорт и летные характеристики. Это один из наиболее экономичных реактивных самолетов с двигателем с двумя турбинами на планете, потребляя 59 галлонов топлива в час. Это объясняет его низкие эксплуатационные расходы и последующую доступность при очень конкурентных ценах. Eclipse 550 не жертвует ничем в отношении летных характеристик, чтобы обеспечить впечатляющую топливную экономичность, т.к. все равно обладает высокой максимальной крейсерской скоростью и дальностью полета выше 2000 км, легко позволяя совершать полеты между основными европейскими городами.  Eclipse - это настоящее воздушное такси, прекрасно подходящее для полетов на короткие расстояния для 3 пассажиров за неповторимо низкую цену.",

Компания добавила семифутовые КАП крыла с целью улучшения вертикальной тяги и снижения лобового сопротивления, также была изменена система перекачки топлива, обеспечив крайне высокие летные характеристики самолета. Этот просторный корпоративный самолет обладает настоящей VIP-кабиной, больше чем у своих конкурентов Dassault и Bombardier, разделенной на 3 отдельные посадочные зоны для максимально комфортного размещения 13 пассажиров. Модель 600 также обладает самым большим грузовым отсеком среди всех самолетов этой категории, в который можно попасть из основной кабины, а также сертифицирована для захода на посадку по крутой глиссаде, позволяя сажать ее на летных полях, недоступных для множества других самолетов. Обладая отличной дальностью полета и роскошным салоном, не удивительно, что Legacy 600 такой популярный большой деловой реактивный самолет, т.к. обеспечивает отличное обслуживание на полетах средней дальности.

      "description": "Компания Embraer описывает Lineage 1000 как «летающие апартаменты», и почти 70 квадратных метров площади кабины легко дают понять, почему. Пятизонная кабина длиннее и уже, чем у Airbus и обладает 5 отдельными зонами, рассчитанными на деловые встречи, питание, отдых и сон, с комфортом размещая 19 пассажиров. Багаж - не проблема, т.к. главный отсек имеет объем более 9 кубических метров, а дополнительный багаж можно положить во внешних запирающихся шкафчиках с дополнительным объемом свыше 3 кубических метров. Lineage 1000 не только крайне просторный, но и очень комфортный, т.к. оснащен ведущими стабилизаторами и технологией обнаружения зон турбулентности для обеспечения плавного полета. Наряду с этим, двигатели с двойным турбонаддувом обеспечивают этому авиалайнеру дальность полета 8000 км, позволяя легко совершать трансконтинентальные перелеты. Учитывая все, можно сказать, что с Lineage 1000 компания Embraer сумела создать самолет, представляющий вершину роскошных путешествий со своей просторной кабиной, сохраняя впечатляющие эксплуатационные возможности.

Этот самолет является ответом компании Gulfstream на запросы клиентов, которым требуется простор в салоне и багажном отделении супер-большого реактивного самолета, но без потребности в совершении дальнемагистральных полетов. Поэтому G350 обладает такими же размерами, что и модель G450, но благодаря отличной дальности полета, как у G450, она стоит меньше. С возможностью совершать беспосадочные полеты на расстояние более 7000 км модель G350 также способна выполнять межконтинентальные полеты и является очень быстрой, гораздо быстрее моделей Challenger 605 и Legacy 600. Оригинальные окна Gulfstream освещают просторную кабину, вмещающую до 12 пассажиров и оснащенную полной бортовой кухней. G350 также имеет низкую зону сжатого воздуха, чтобы снизить утомляемость в полете и обеспечить прибытие пассажиров в пункт назначения отдохнувшими. Быстрый, просторный и комфортабельный; G350 является отличным решением для ваших полетов на средние расстояния.  ",

Поэтому она может совершать полеты между Нью-Йорком и Дохой, Парижем и Сингапуром или между Шанхаем и Женевой, а за счет отличной максимальной скорости может делать это за отличное время. Этот реактивный самолет хвалят не только за его летные характеристики, но и за просторный салон с 3 раздельными посадочными зонами, вмещающими до 14 пассажиров с отличным комфортом. Он оснащен современной технологией шумоподавления и 14 оригинальными овальными окнами, обеспечивающими тишину и проникновение большого количества света в кабину, в то время как 100% система подачи свежего воздуха и максимальная высота в кабине 6000 футов снижают такие эффекты путешествия, как утомление и синдром смены часовых поясов. В общем, с моделью G550 компания Gulfstream создала флагманский реактивный самолет, способный не только доставить вас в более удаленное место с более высокой скоростью, но и гарантирующий ваше прибытие отдохнувшими.",

Он летает выше, дальше и быстрее, чем его конкуренты, и обладает впечатляющей дальностью полета для самолета этого размера, способен совершать беспосадочные перелеты из Лондона в Москву или с восточного на западное побережье США. Он сертифицирован для захода на посадку по крутой глиссаде на таких аэродромах, как Лондон Сити или Сьон, добавляя существенное преимущество этому и так популярному самолету. Он впечатляет внутри и, благодаря его овальной кабине, предлагает больше посадочных мест, чем любой из его конкурентов, а также обладает широкими проходами и большим пространством для ног при общей вместимости до 8 пассажиров. Модель G150 представляет отличное решение для любого пассажира, собирающегося совершить внутриевропейский полет как можно быстрее, сохраняя высокую степень комфорта в его просторной кабине. ",

Хотя G500 не обладает той же дальностью полета, что и его родственный самолет, и поэтому относится к категории супер-больших реактивных самолетов, он имеет такую же очень просторную кабину. В то же время он может совершать путешествия на впечатляющие расстояния, легко соединяя Москву и Нью-Йорк или Лондон с Дубаем, и делать это на высокой скорости. В основном это обусловлено тем, что оптимизированная конструкция крыла и турбовентилятор G500, обеспечивающие возможность летать быстрее и выше, чем любой коммерческий самолет, вдали от воздушных путей коммерческих лайнеров и выше неблагоприятных погодных условий. Большая, 3-зонная кабина вмещает до 14 пассажиров в дневной конфигурации или до 7 пассажиров - в ночной. Она оснащена туалетом, находящимся под давлением багажным отделением, в которое можно попасть во время полета, и полностью оборудованной бортовой кухней впереди.

Он также обладает точностью выдерживания графика вылетов 99,75% с 2001 по 2011 гг., когда было доставлено свыше 150 самолетов.

Если отбросить название, этот супер-среднеразмерный реактивный самолет привлек мировое внимание с момента своего появления на рынке в 2012 году благодаря невероятным летным характеристикам. Он имеет отличную дальность полета выше 6600 км, дальше, чем у конкурентов Cessna, Bombardier и Hawker; он очень быстрый и установил ряд новых рекордов в межгородских полетах. Gulfstream считает, что эта модель также имеет самый низкий расход топлива в своей категории и лучшую комфортабельную кабину. Салон модели G280 не только больше и просторнее, чем у конкурентов, вмещая до 9 пассажиров в конфигурации Club 4, на трехместном диване и на двух дополнительных креслах, но и оснащен современными технологиями, обеспечивая тишину в кабине.

Самолет имеет тот же привлекательный дизайн, что и 850XP, в форме гладких КАП крыла и хвостового руля, обладающего большим углом стреловидности, модернизация с целью повышения летных характеристик обеспечивает модели 900XP лучшую по сравнению с предшественниками дальность полета и максимальную крейсерскую скорость. Кабина также тише, обеспечивая более приятное и расслабляющее путешествие. На этом самолете стандартно присутствует бортпроводник.",

      "description": "Первая модель компании Hawker Beechcraft, Hawker 750, совершила свой первый полет в конце 2007 года и с тех пор стала популярным супер-легким реактивным самолетом. Производя модель 750, компания Hawker Beechcraft модернизировала ведущую в мире серию самолетов Hawker 800, представив реактивный самолет меньших размеров с уменьшенной топливной емкостью, чтобы освободить пространство для багажа. Поэтому он обладает несопоставимой дальностью полета по сравнению с другими, более крупными представителями семейства Hawker, будучи при этом очень конкурентоспособным в своей категории, способным совершать более длительные беспосадочные полеты, чем Citation XLS+ и Learjet 45XR. Он также имеет комфортабельную,прочную кабину, гораздо более просторную, чем у Learjet 45XR, легко вмещая до 8 пассажиров. Модель Hawker 750 обладает балансом впечатляющих летных характеристик и высококачественного салона и является отличным супер-легким реактивным самолетом. ",

Модель Hawker 1000, тем самым, предоставляет характеристики снижения и комфорт в кабине, а также крайне надежна. Более того, этот самолет часто является отличным вариантом, т.к. зачастую представлен на рынке по гораздо более привлекательной цене, чем большинство других супер-среднеразмерных реактивных самолетов, в частности Gulfstream и Dassault.

Он способен подниматься на высоту до 41000 футов менее чем за 19 минут, быстро поднимаясь над другим воздушным трафиком и потенциально неблагоприятными погодными условиями. Он также известен своими возможностями на высокой высоте, поскольку может летать на высоте более 6000 км с максимальной крейсерской скоростью почти 900 км/ч, доставляя пассажиров в удаленные места назначения за короткое время. Салон просторный и хорошо освещенный благодаря 7 большим окнам с каждой стороны и может вмещать до 8 пассажиров, обычно с компоновкой кресел double Club 4. В нем также оборудовано находящееся под давлением багажное отделение, в которое можно пройти во время полета.

Самый крупный реактивный самолет в своей категории, Hondajet может принять 5 пассажиров в своей просторной кабине, обеспечивая комфорт в полетах на короткие расстояния. Его инновационная конструкция имеет усовершенствованные технологии и концепции, благодаря чему получился самолет, который не только легко воспринимается визуально, но и является самым быстрым и наиболее экономичным в отношении расхода топлива самолетом в своем классе, частично за счет установки двигателя над крылом. Honda заверяет, что ее VLJ превосходит своих конкурентов по дальности полета и, конечно, способен совершать прямые внутриевропейские полеты, например, из Парижа на Ибицу или из Женевы в Берлин. ",

Она имеет ряд внешних и внутренних изменений, сохранив при этом просторную кабину Hawker, которая очень широкая и высокая для самолета категории легких реактивных самолетов. Салон был модифицирован, став самым тихим в классе благодаря новому пакету акустической изоляции 400XT, при этом принимая, как и его предшественник, до 6 пассажиров в конфигурации Club 4 и 2 на дополнительных отдельных креслах. Снаружи изменения 400XT включают аэродинамические усовершенствования, улучшенную конфигурацию креплений двигателя и более современные двигатели с двумя турбовентиляторами. Как следствие, модель 400XT обладает отличной дальностью полета и крайне быстра и экономична, обеспечивая низкий расход топлива. В общем, Nextant удалось добавить исключительных летных характеристик к хорошо известному, ведущему в классе простору кабины Hawker, чтобы создать легкий реактивный самолет, который прекрасно подходит для деловых поездок или отдыха по выходным.

Впечатляет не только стиль Avanti, но и очень высокие летные характеристики и возможность летать гораздо дальше и быстрее, чем любой другой реактивный самолет в этой категории В действительности, ее скорость и дальность полета настолько большие, что она конкурирует с некоторыми реактивными самолетами, а топливная экономичность почти на 40% больше, чем у большинства деловых реактивных самолетов. Самолет, вмещающий 7 пассажиров, также похож на самолет другой, более дорогой категории, т.к. у него тихая кабина, шире и выше, чем у любого самолета в линейке Cessna CJ. Это сочетание высоких летных характеристик и комфорта, неслыханная для самолета этого класса, означает, что модель также обладает фантастическим соотношением цена-качество. ",

Bei der King Air 350i wurde der Platz in der klasseführenden Kabine optimiert. Topmoderne Technik reduziert Geräusche, die durch die Vibration des Flugzeugsrumpfes entstehen. So werden neue Standards für eine ruhige Kabine in einem Turboprop-Flugzeug gesetzt. Das Flugzeug kann auch auf kurzen Rollbahnen landen, so dass Sie auf kleinen Flughäfen landen kännen, die oft näher an Ihrem endgültigen Ziel liegen. Seine lange Kabine ist mit zwei Vierersitzgruppen ausgestattet und bietet bis zu 8 Passagieren Platz. Sein Gepäckraum ist beheizt und als Druckkabine ausgebaut und während des Fluges voll zugänglich. Zusätzliches Gepäck kann in externen Spinden untergebracht werden. Neben der extrem komfortablen Kabine wird die King Air für ihre hohe Leistung und den beispiellosen Brennstoffwirkungsgrad gelobt, der für die geringen Betriebskosten verantwortlich ist. Die King Air 350i ist perfekt für Kurzstreckenflüge zu beliebigen Flughäfen geeignet, da sie die Passagiere mit weniger Treibstoff weiter fliegt, und das zu einem tollen Preis. ",

Nach einer Serie von Aktualisierungen über die Jahre, wurde im Juli 2009 die King Air 90GTx auf den Markt gebracht. Sie sollte die C90GTi ersetzen. Der Anbau schnittiger Winglets verbesserte Steig- und Fluggeschwindigkeit und steigerte Brennstoffwirkungsgrad und Leistung. Ihre Reichweite hat sich um über 20% gesteigert, so dass Sie noch weiter reisen kännen - 1060 Seemeilen bei Hächstgeschwindigkeit mit fünf Erwachsenen an Bord. Obwohl es sich um das kleinste Flugzeug der King Air-Reihe handelt, finden bis zu 5 Passagieren bequem Platz. Das Cockpit ist mit erstklassiger Turbolenzenerkennung und Avioniksystemen ausgestattet, sich man sonst nur auf grä¤eren Flugzeugen mit noch grä¤eren Preisen findet. Der Reiz dieses ausgezeichneten Turboprop-Flugzeugs wird noch dadurch gesteigert, dass es dort landen kann, wo viele Jets nicht landen kännen. Alles in allem ist dieses kleine Flugzeug mit Funktionen gro¤er Jets vollgepackt und bietet ausgezeichnete Reichweite und Brennstoffwirkungsgrad. ",

Boeing bietet eine gro¤e Vielfalt an Raumgestaltungsvarianten an, ganz nach Ihren Vorlieben. Diese bestehen im Allgemeinen aus 5 getrennten Schlaf- und Wohnbereichen, einschlie¤lich einer Schlafzimmersuite, einem Konferenz-/Esszimmer, einem Büro und opulenten Lounge-Bereichen, sowie Luxusbadezimmern und einer voll ausgestatteten Küche, in der die feinsten Speisen zubereitet werden kännen. Der BBJ zeichnet sich auch durch hervorragende Leistung aus. Der Kraftstoffverbrauch wurde kürzlich optimiert und er hat eine grä¤ere Reichweite als die Lineage und die ACJ320, was hauptsächlich seiner intelligenten Bauweise und den extrem starken Triebwerken zuzuschreiben ist. Hochmoderne Technologie sorgt dafür, dass der BBJ diesen hohen Standard leisten kann. Er nimmt Sie mit auf transkontinentale Flüge, während die Kabine ruhig und stabil bleibt, so dass Sie in Ruhe und Gemütlichkeit entspannen kännen.  Boeing verbessert die BBJs laufend, fügt Kraftstofftanks hinzu, um die Reichweite zu vergrä¤ern oder aktualisiert die Technologie, um die Effizienz zu verbessern. So bietet dieses Flugzeug dauerhaft eine erstaunliche Kombination von unglaublicher Leistung und unschlagbarem Komfort. ",

      "description": "Es ist noch nicht sicher, wann Global 7000 auf den Markt kommt, wahrscheinlich wird es 2016 sein. Es ist jedoch nicht überraschend, dass seit ihrer Vorstellung 2010 in Atlanta so viele Bestellungen für die Global 7000 abgegeben wurden, da das Flugzeug bisher nicht dagewesene Geräumigkeit in der einzigartigen Kabine besitzt, die aus 4 getrennten Wohnbereichen besteht. Ihre gro¤en Fenster, die grä¤er sind als bei jedem anderen Flugzeug dieser Kategorie, bieten spektakuläre Ausblicke und der exquisite Esstisch für sechs Personen strahlt Luxus aus. Zusätzlich zum optimalen Komfort sorgen die intelligente Bauweise und topaktuelle Technologie der Global 7000 für geringen Schadstoffaussto¤ und hohe Leistung. Dieses Langstreckenflugzeug wird Passagiere auf Nonstop-Reisen zwischen Gro¤städten, z.B. von London nach Singapur oder von New York nach Dubai in einer komfortablen, gemütlichen Umgebung transportieren.

Dieses Flugzeug wird bis zu 13 Passagiere von L.A. nach Sydney oder von Hong Kong nach New York bringen kännen. Nicht nur die unvergleichliche Reichweite der Global 8000 wird ihre Mitbewerber umhauen, sondern auch die unglaublich luxuriäse Innenausstattung, die jedem Passagier eine entspannende Reise garantiert, egal ob er in einem der gemütlichen Betten schläft, einen Film auf dem Gro¤bildschirm anschaut oder den Blick durch die riesigen Fenster des Flugzeugs genie¤t. Die Triebwerke der nächsten Generation sorgen nicht nur für eine ruhige Kabine, sondern sind auch hocheffizient, verbrauchen weniger Treibstoff und erzeugen weniger Abgase als je zuvor.",

Dank ihrer neuen Turbofan-Triebwerke ist die 60XR einer der schnellsten Midsize Jets auf dem Markt. Aufgrund ihrer gro¤en Flughähe (sie ist für eine Hähe von rund 15.000 m zugelassen) kann sie dem Luftverkehr und dem Risiko widriger Wetterbedingungen aus dem Weg gehen. Deshalb kann die 60XR Sie auf direktestem Weg an Ihr Ziel bringen und Turbulenzen vermeiden, damit Sie einen ruhigen Flug haben. Auch der Brennstoffwirkungsgrad ist sehr gut. In der Kabine finden bequem bis zu 7 Passagiere in einer Vierersitzgruppe, einem Einzelplatz und einem Zweisitzersofa Platz. Das Flugzeug ist mit der neuesten Technologie ausgestattet, inklusive schnellem Internetzugang, MP3-Anschlüssen und LED-Beleuchtung. Dieser Midsize Jet der Oberklasse ist die perfekte Wahl für jeden Mittelstreckenflug, da er Unterhaltung und guten Service bietet. ",

Diese Verbesserungen bestanden in besserer Leistung, deutlich häherer maximaler Reisefluggeschwindigkeit, Steiggeschwindigkeit und Startfähigkeit. Obwohl es von allen Geschäftsflugzeugen der Kategorie Light von Cessna die kleinste Kabine besitzt, es  doch deutlich geräumiger als die Mustang, Cessnas Very Light Jet und bietet bequem Platz für bis zu 4 Passagiere. Eine kleine Toilette und ein zusätzlicher Sitzplatz vor der Tür, der sich für ein Kind eignet, sind auch vorhanden. Mit einer Reichweite von bis zu 3 Stunden ununterbrochener Flugzeit und erhältlich zu einem hervorragenden Preis, stellen CJ1 und CJ1+ gro¤artige Mäglichkeit für innereuropäische Reisen dar, wie z.B. Geschäftsreisen oder Wochenendtrips. ",

Mit einer Reichweite von über 3700 km und der Hächstgeschwindigkeit von 839 km/h, ist die CJ4 einer der leistungsstärksten Light Jets auf dem Markt. Sie bietet auch gro¤artige Start- und Landefähigkeiten, durch die sie Zugang zu Flughäfen mit kurzen Rollbahnen hat, wie Lugano und St. Tropez, die oft sehr günstig gelegen sind. Das topmoderne Wetterradarsystem hilft bei der Entdeckung mäglicherweise widriger Wetterbedingung weit im Vorfeld, so dass Turbulenzen vermieden werden und ein stärungsfreier Flug garantiert wird.

For many years, the Citation VII was the most popular aircraft in its category and it remains an excellent option because it provides an excellent balance between comfort and price.",

Im Laufe der folgenden zehn Jahre wurden zahlreiche Leistungsverbesserungen und Kabinen-Upgrades durchgeführt, die in der Auslieferung der XLS und später, im Jahr 2008, der XLS+ gipfelten. Die Citation XLS+ bietet die grä¤te Reichweite aller Excel-Flugzeuge der Kategorie Super Light und schafft beinahe 3500 km ununterbrochenen Fluges. Sie besitzt au¤erdem eine extrem geräumige Kabine, die leicht für 8 Passagiere Platz bietet, mit 6 Einzelsitzplätzen und einem Zweisitzer-Sofa vorn. Die LXS+ fliegt au¤erdem mit hoher Geschwindigkeit und ist für die Landung auf kurzen Flugplätzen zertifiziert, die für grä¤ere Flugzeuge nicht zugänglich sind, sich jedoch oft näher am eigentlichen Ziel Ihrer Reise befinden. Effizient, komfortabel und direkt, ist Cessnas neuestes Modell der Excel-Serie ideal für Kurzstreckenflüge und ist besonders für innereuropäische Flüge beliebt, z.B. für Geschäftsreisen oder Wochenendtrips.

Mit einer Reichweite von über 5600 km, kann die Citation X Interkontinentalflüge absolvieren und beispielsweise nonstop von Dubai nach Nizza fliegen. Diese ausgezeichnete Leistung liegt an den übergro¤en Doppelturbo-Triebwerken von Rolls Royce und die intelligenten Designmerkmale des Flugzeug, wie die leicht wiedererkennbaren profilierten Flügel und Winglets. Stylish und modern bietet das Innere der Citation X alle Annehmlichkeiten, die man in einem topmodernen Geschäftsflugzeug erwarten würde. Bis zu 8 Passagiere passen in die geräumige Kabine, die zwei Vierersitzgruppen für eine angenehme Reise bietet. So kombiniert die Citation X ihre au¤ergewähnliche Leistung mit einem angenehmen und entspannenden Flugerlebnis. ",

Seit 2005 wurden über 350 dieser äu¤erst beliebten Jets hergestellt und an Betreiber geliefert. Embraer und Honda brachten als Reaktion beide ebenfalls VLJs auf den Markt. Obwohl diese minimal grä¤er sind als die Mustang, ist ihre Kabine doch komfortabel und bietet Platz für 4 Passagiere. Au¤erdem besitzt dieses Flugzeuge ein ausgezeichnetes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Es ist oft der günstigste Jet auf dem Markt und schlägt häufig sogar Turboprobs in finanzieller Hinsicht. Alles in allem ist die Mustang perfekt für innereuropäische Kurzstreckenflüge, eintägige Geschäftsreisen und Wochenendausflüge geeignet. ",

Wie der LX, bietet 2000S eine geräumige Kabine, in der man stehen kann und die bequem bis zu 10 Passagieren in einer Vierersitzgruppe und 6 Einzelsitzen Platz bietet. Der Hauptunterschied zwischen ihnen besteht in der au¤ergewähnlichen Leistung der 2000S bei langsamer Geschwindigkeit, wodurch sie den grünsten Fu¤abdruck der gesamten Falcon-Serie von Dassault hat. Diese Leistung bei geringer Geschwindigkeit reduziert auch die Landestrecke der 2000S auf 705 Meter, so dass dieser Jet Zugang zu 50 % mehr Flughäfen hat als andere Flugzeuge dieser Klasse. Deshalb kann er Sie zu abgelegeneren Landebahnen fliegen, die oft näher an Ihrem endgültigen Reiseziel liegen.

Die hohe Leistung verdankt es zum Teil den drei ultramodernen Turbofan-Triebwerken, die die 7X antreiben und zum Teil dem intelligenten, stromlinienfärmigen Design des Flugzeugs. Die Bauweise der Au¤enhülle vergrä¤ert nicht nur die Effizienz des Jets, sondern auch den Komfort in der Kabine, denn schnittige Winglets und horizontale Stabilisatoren stellen sicher, dass Ihr Flug gleichmä¤ig und entspannend verläuft. Dieses Langstreckenflugzeug besitzt auch eine gefällige Kabine mit Platz für bis zu 14 Passagiere mit maximalem Komfort und ausgezeichneter Bordtechnologie, damit Ihr Flug unterhaltsam und angenehm wird. Alles in allem ist die 7X luxuriäs und effizient und bietet einen gro¤artigen Service. ",

      "description": "Die erste Dassault 8X, das langerwartete neueste Modell der Falcon-Familie, wird voraussichtlich Ende 2016 ausgeliefert. Dieses neue Vorzeigemodell der Falcon-Reihe gehört wie die 7X zur Kategorie der Long Range Jets. Es liefert in jedem Bereich ausgezeichnete Ergebnisse und zeichnet sich dadurch als Flugzeug der Oberklasse aus. Triebwerksverbesserungen, raffinierte Aerodynamik und höhere Treibstoffkapazität verleihen der 8X eine unglaubliche Reichweite, die erheblich höher ist als bei der 7X und sogar besser als bei der Global 6000 von Bombardier. Dadurch kann die Falcon 8X Flüge zwischen so entfernten Städten wie von Paris nach Singapur und von New York nach Peking absolvieren und das mit einer hohen Reisefluggeschwindigkeit, so dass Sie Ihr Ziel in hervorragender Zeit erreichen. Das Flugzeug ist mit topmoderner Technik ausgestattet, die für einen beeindruckenden Brennstoffwirkungsgrad sorgt, sowie mit Wettererkennungs- und Stabilisierungssystemen für eine ruhige Reise. Die geräumige Kabine ist länger als bei der Falcon 7X und bietet bis zu 15 Passagieren einen äußerst komfortablen und angenehmen Flug in einer der vielen verfügbaren Sitzanordnungen. Dassault ist bei der Herstellung der Falcon 8X keine Kompromisse eingegangen. Das Resultat ist ein Long Range Jet, dessen extrem hohe Leistung zu seiner optimierten Innenausstattung passt.",

Es gibt viele Adaptionen dieses Flugzeugs: 900, 900B und 900C sind ältere Versionen, 900EX ist eine ältere Langstreckenversion und 900LX ist die neueste Langstreckenversion. Die DX, obwohl sie als Super Large klassifiziert ist und nicht als Long Range, kann trotzdem locker nonstop von Paris nach Chicago fliegen, und das mit einer beeindruckenden Reisefluggeschwindigkeit von 878 km/h. Sie besitzt einen ausgezeichneten Innenraum, der in drei getrennte Bereiche geteilt ist und am Tag bis zu 13 Passagieren Platz bietet. Zum Schlafen finden 7 Personen in bequemen Betten Platz. Sie ist au¤erdem mit allen Annehmlichkeiten ausgestattet, die man an Bord eines Jets der Oberklasse erwarten würde, einschlie¤lich einer vollständigen Bordküche im Vorderbereich. ",

Die Kabine ist geräumiger als bei vielen Jets der Kategorie Large und sogar als bei einigen Super Large Jets und ist mit über 2 Metern höher, als die von Embraers VIP-Flugzeug Lineage 1000.

Bis zu 14 Passagiere können in diesem luxuriösen Flugzeug reisen, das außerdem eindrucksvolle Leistung verspricht. Es ist in Reichweite und Reisefluggeschwindigkeit führend in seiner Klasse und übertrifft in diesen Punkten tatsächlich oft sogar Super Large Jets.

Als dreistrahliges Flugzeug hat die Falcon 50EX aufgrund der drei montierten Turbofans am Ende des Flugzeugs einen hohen Wiedererkennungseffekt der, kombiniert mit dem schnittigen Design ein sehr stylisches Geschäftsflugzeug zur Folge hat. Die 50EX ist sicherlich nicht mehr Schein als Sein, denn sie bietet gute Leistung auf kurzen Rollbahnen, eine vernünftige Reichweite und schafft eine hähere maximale Reisefluggeschwindigkeit, als viele ihrer Mitbewerber, beispielsweise Bombardier Challenger 300. Trotz der kürzesten Kabine der Dassault-Privatflugzeuge, bietet die 50EX bequem Platz für bis zu 9 Passagiere. Alles in allem, hat Dassault mit der Falcon 50EX ein hocheffizientes Geschäftsflugzeug geschaffen, das ideal für Mittelstreckenflüge geeignet ist. ",

Das Ergebnis: ein extrem leistungsstarkes Flugzeug. Dieses geräumige Geschäftsflugzeug besitzt eine echte VIP-Kabine, die grä¤er ist als die der Rivalen von Dassault und Bombardier und in 3 getrennte Sitzbereiche aufgeteilt ist, um optimalen Komfort für bis zu 13 Passagieren zu garantieren. Die 600 besitzt auch den grä¤ten Gepäckraum eines Flugzeugs dieser Kategorie, der von der Hauptkabine aus zugänglich ist. Sie ist auch für Steilanflüge zugelassen und kann so auf Flughäfen landen, die von vielen anderen Flugzeugen nicht angeflogen werden kännen. Es ist nicht verwunderlich, dass die Legacy 600 mit ihrer gro¤en Reichweite und luxuriäser Innenausstattung so beliebt in der Kategorie Large Business Jet ist, denn sie bietet ausgezeichneten Service auf Mittelstreckenflügen.

      "description": "Embraers neues Geschäftsflugzeug, Legacy 450, wurde 2014 zertifiziert und wird voraussichtlich 2015 in Betrieb gehen. Es wird das erste Flugzeug des Brasilianischen Herstellers mit einem Fly-by-Wire-Cockpit sein, sowie das erste in der Kategorie Super Light Jets. Durch diese Innovation werden viele der Betriebsabläufe des Flugzeugs digitalisiert und damit die manuelle Arbeitslast der Piloten reduziert, sowie Leistung und Verlässlichkeit des Flugzeugs erhäht. Konsequenterweise wird erwartet, dass die Legacy 450 der Super Light Jet mit der besten Leistung auf dem Markt sein und eine grä¤ere Reichweite als ihre Mitbewerber Cessna und Bombardier haben wird, sowie einen besseren Brennstoffwirkungsgrad. Zusätzlich zur beeindruckenden Leistungsfähigkeit wird dieser Jet auch die grä¤te Kabine seiner Klasse aufweisen, mit Plätzen für bis zu 7 Passagiere bei optimalem Komfort. Au¤erdem bietet er über 4 Kubikmeter Gepäckraum, nie dagewesen in einem Jet dieser Kategorie. Da bereits viele Bestellungen vorliegen, scheint es klar, dass die Legacy 450 die Versprechungen von Embraer einhalten und einen au¤ergewähnlichen Service auf Kurz- und Mittelstreckenflügen bieten wird.

Die Lineage 1000 ist nicht nur extrem geräumig, sondern auch sehr komfortabel, da sie erstklassige Stabilisatoren und Technologie zur Erfassung von Turbulenzen enthält, die für einen stärungsfreien Flug sorgen. Au¤erdem geben die Biturbo-Triebwerke diesem VIP-Flugzeug eine Reichweite von über 8000 km, so dass es Transkontinentalflüge mit Leichtigkeit absolvieren kann. Alles in allem hat Embraer mit der Lineage 1000 ein Flugzeug entwickelt, das mit seiner geräumigen Kabine den Gipfel der Luxusreisen darstellt und gleichzeitig beeindruckende Leistung zeigt. ",

Consequently, the GIII achieves a significantly greater range than its predecessor, while maintaining the exceptional reliability for which Gulfstream aircraft are renowned. The GIII features an extremely spacious stand-up cabin, that typically caters to 12-14 passengers in its executive seating configuration but certain variations can accommodate up to 19. Excelling in every department, from comfort to performance, the GIII is a first-rate business jet that is still capable of providing an excellent service.",

      "description": "G650 ist Gulfstreams Vorzeigemodell unter den Langstreckenflugzeugen, das den Standard für seine Nachfolger setzt. Es bietet die grä¤te Reichweite unter allen Geschäftsflugzeugen dieser Klasse und kann beispielsweise New York mit Dubai verbinden. Mit einer unglaublichen maximalen Reisefluggeschwindigkeit ist G650 auch das schnellste Langstreckenflugzeug auf dem Markt. Es erreicht fast Schallgeschwindigkeit und wird von zwei herausragenden und effizienten BR725-Triebwerken von Rolls-Royce angetrieben. Es fliegt daher schneller und weiter als jedes andere Flugzeug dieser Kategorie und das - wegen seiner besonders gro¤en Kabine - auch noch mit äu¤erstem Komfort. Es bietet leicht Platz für bis zu 13 Passagiere in luxuriäsen Liegesesseln und Sofas, die auf drei getrennte Sitzbereiche aufgeteilt sind. Die G650 besitzt auch die neueste Entertainment-Technologie, hervorragende Leistung und die aktuellsten Erkennungssysteme für Turbulenzen, sowie geräuschreduzierende Systeme und sorgt so für einen ruhigen, gleichmä¤igen und entspannenden Flug. Wie bei der G550 konnte Gulfstream auch hier die Reisemüdigkeit der Passagiere durch den Einbau eines 100%-Frischluftsystems und einer maximalen Kabinendruckhähe von rund 1.800 Metern reduzieren. ",

Intelligent aerodynamic design and powerful, fuel efficient engines provide the GV with its exceptional range and maximum cruise speed and enable it to complete uninterrupted flights from London to Los Angeles and Paris to Hong Kong. The GV is also known for its reliability and Gulfstream&rsquo;s most recent flagship aircraft, the G550 and G650, the pinnacle of ultra-high performance business jets, are modelled on its design. The GV&rsquo;s cabin is quiet, spacious and comfortable and usually caters for 14 passengers, although it can accommodate up to 19 in certain configurations. Combining revolutionary range with excellent reliability and ultimate comfort, the GV remains a first-rate Long Range Jet.",

Sie kann weiterhin beeindruckende Entfernungen zurücklegen und verbindet mit Leichtigkeit Moskau mit New York oder London mit Dubai, und das mit hoher Geschwindigkeit. Dies liegt zu einem Gro¤teil an der optimierten Flügelbauform der G500 und am Turbofan, wodurch sie schneller und häher fliegen kann, als jedes Verkehrsflugzeug. Dadurch kann sie dem kommerziellen Flugverkehr aus dem Weg gehen und über widrige Wetterbedingungen hinweg fliegen. In der gro¤en Kabine mit drei Zonen haben bis zu 14 Passagiere in der Tagesanordnung Platz und bis zu 7 Passagiere in der Nachtanordnung. Es hat ein WC im hinteren Bereich, der Gepäckraum ist als Druckkabine auch während des Fluges zugänglich und im vorderen Bereich befindet sich eine voll ausgestattete Bordküche.

The GIV&rsquo;s intelligent design, stylish exterior and powerful engines help to explain the aircraft&rsquo;s popularity and why its production lasted nearly 20 years, during which time it succeeded in setting over 50 world records for round-the-world flights. The GIV&rsquo;s impressive range, reliability and overall performance, along with its large stand-up cabin mean that, unlike its predecessors, it is categorised as a Super Large Jet. The spacious interior typically accommodates 14 passengers in optimum comfort but, in certain configurations, the GIV can seat up to 19. Gulfstream&rsquo;s most recent aircraft, including the G450, G550 and G650, are all modelled from the original GIV, a true testament to an aircraft that set the standard in its class for so many years.",

Es hat eine ausgezeichnete Reichweite von über 6600 km, weiter als seine Rivalen von Cessna, Bombardier und Hawker und ist sehr schnell, so dass es eine Reihe neuer Rekorde bei der Verbindung zweier Städte aufgestellt hat. Gulfstream ist überzeugt, dass es auch den besten Brennstoffwirkungsgrad seiner Kategorie besitzt und fordert jeden heraus, eine bequemere Kabine zu finden. Der Innenraum der G280 ist mit Platz für bis zu 9 Passagiere in einer Vierersitzgruppe, einem Dreisitzer-Sofa und zwei zusätzlichen Sitzen nicht nur grä¤er und geräumiger als bei ihren Mitbewerbern, sondern besitzt auch hochmoderne Technik, um eine ruhige Kabinenumgebung zu erzeugen.

Die 400XP war auf dem US-Markt stets besonders beliebt und ist seit ihrer europäischen Markteinführung 2010 auch in Europa sehr gefragt. Dies liegt zu einem gro¤en Teil an ihrer au¤ergewähnlich guten Innenausstattung mit einer Kabine, die länger und breiter ist als die der Cessna Citation CJ1, 2 und 3 und 7 Passagiere in einer Vierersitzgruppe und 3 Einzelplätzen transportieren kann. Alles in allem bietet die Hawker 400XP einen komfortablen und effizienten Service, der sie perfekt für innereuropäische Flüge macht. ",

      "description": "Hawker Beechcraft brachte Premier 1A 2005 als Nachfolgemodell von Premier 1 auf den Markt. Das erstaunlichste Merkmal von Premier 1A ist die geräumige Kabine, die nicht nur häher und breiter ist, als die aller Mitbewerber von Cessna, sondern auch als die aller anderen Flugzeuge dieser Klasse. Obwohl Premier 1A als Light Jet klassifiziert ist, ist die Kabinenbreite und -hähe tatsächlich grä¤er als bei einigen Super Light Jets, beispielsweise Learjet 45XR. Demnach ist Premier 1A ein extrem geräumiges Flugzeug und bietet bequem Platz für bis zu 6 Passagiere in einer Vierersitzgruppe und 2 zusätzlichen Einzelplätzen. Für den au¤ergewähnlichen Innenraum dieses Flugzeugs ist hauptsächlich sein einzigartiger Rumpf aus Verbundwerkstoff verantwortlich, der auch für eine vernünftige Reichweite und eine gute maximale Reisefluggeschwindigkeit von Premier 1A sorgt. Diese Kombination aus Leistung und Komfort macht Premier 1A zu einem sehr beliebten Flugzeug und einer guten Wahl für Kurzstreckenflüge. ",

Um die 750 herzustellen, wandelte Hawker Beechcraft die weltweit führende Flugzeugserie Hawker 800 ab und produzierte einen kleineren Jet mit geringerer Treibstoffkapazität, der mehr Platz für Gepäck bietet. Ihre Reichweite ist daher geringer als die der größeren Mitglieder der Hawker-Familie, jedoch trotzdem sehr konkurrenzfähig in ihrer Kategorie. Sie kann längere Flüge ohne Zwischenlandung absolvieren als die Citation XLS+ und die Learjet 45XR. Sie besitzt eine komfortable Kabine mit Stehhöhe, die viel geräumiger ist als die der Learjet 45XR und bequem bis zu 8 Passagieren Platz bietet. Die Hawker 750 besitzt eine ausgewogene Kombination von beeindruckender Leistung und qualitativ hochwertiger Innenausstattung. Das Resultat: ein ausgezeichneter Super Light Jet. ",

Die PC-24 kann somit auf über 21.000 Landebahnen landen, weit mehr als andere Privatjets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDie beeindruckende Reichweite der PC-24 wird im Bereich der Phenom 300 und der Ctation CJ4 sein.\r\nDie Kabine verspricht den Komfort eines Midsize Jets zum Preis eines Light Jets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDie PC-24 wird über die längste und breiteste Kabine aller Jets Ihrer Kategorie verfügen.\r\nAußerdem wird eine Menge Gepäckplatz an Bord sein, dank des überarbeiteten Laderaumes. Pilatus hat es geschafft die Industrie zu überzeugen, was man an der hohen Anzahl der Vorbestellungen sehen kann. Dieser Light Jet ist die perfekte Symbiose zwischen Leistungsfähigkeit und Komfort.<br>\r\n",

Das Flugzeug wurde schnell zu einem beliebten Turboprop Airliner, das von einer Vielzahl von verschiedenen zivilen Luftfahrzeugbetreibern und Fluggesellschaften eingesetzt wurde. Die Saab 340 bietet ähnliche Leistung wie die Dornier 328 Turboprob und ist auch ähnlich groß. Sie bietet Platz für bis zu 33 Passagiere in einer ökonomischen Anordnung, wobei es Variationen dieser Sitzordnung gibt, so dass einige Flugzeuge 34 oder 36 Sitzplätze haben. Als Turboprop-Flugzeug hat die Saab 340 eine begrenzte Reichweite, die sie auf Kurzstreckenflüge beschränkt. Die große Kapazität und der ausgezeichnete Preis machen die Saab 340 zu einer sehr guten Lösung für Kurzstreckenflüge.",

Infatti la fusoliera risulta accorciata rispetto ai modelli più grandi ma la cabina mantiene l'eccezionale larghezza di 3,7 m e l'altezza di 2,25 m equivalente ai più grandi ACJ319, 320 e 321. I benefici sono innumerevoli. Tra questi, assieme a una spaziosa cabina, vi è la capacità di atterrare su aeroporti inaccessibili ad aerei di maggiori dimensioni, ad esempio London City, per il quale l'ACJ318 Elite è certificato. Il lussuoso interno dell'ACJ318 ospita facilmente 18 passeggeri e la cabina è suddivisa in 4 diverse sezioni, comprese aree salotto e una stanza privata che si sdoppia in un ufficio e una confortevole camera da letto. I serbatoi extra di carburante sull'aereo estendono la sua autonomia a circa 8.000 km, rendendolo perfettamente in grado di effettuare viaggi intercontinentali. Lanciato nel 2005 come A318 Elite, prima del cambio nome nel 2011, l'ACJ318 Elite è anche il più giovane nella categoria di jet aziendali di Airbus e si caratterizza per una tecnologia all'avanguardia.

L'ACJ320 oltre che dalle sue elevate prestazioni, è caratterizzato da un interno cabina che lo distingue nettamente dai suoi rivali. Possiede quasi 100 metri quadrati di superficie, che permette una molteplicità di possibili configurazioni interne. Per esempio, l'interno può offrire 5 zone giorno separate, compresa una camera da letto principale, aree salotto, una seconda camera da letto ed una stanza da pranzo/per conferenze. Grazie all'avanzata tecnologia di isolamento acustico, l'ACJ320 offre una cabina particolarmente silenziosa, perfetta per garantire un volo rilassante e in totale relax.

Dopo una serie di aggiornamenti nel corso degli anni, il King Air 90GTx è stato lanciato nel luglio del 2009. E' stato progettato per sostituire il C90GTi e l'aggiunta di sottili alette alle estremità alari incrementa le velocità di salita e crociera e migliora l'efficienza nei consumi e le  prestazioni. La sua autonomia è stata aumentata di oltre il 20%, per cui può portarvi ancora più lontano rispetto alle precedenti versioni, si tratta di un range di 1.060 NM a velocità elevata con cinque adulti a bordo. Anche se è il più piccolo aeromobile della serie King Air, ospita comunque fino a 5 passeggeri. La cabina di pilotaggio si caratterizza per sistemi di avionica e rilevazione delle turbolenze di ultimo modello, di solito presenti su aerei più grandi che hanno prezzi superiori. La popolarità di questo eccellente aereo a turboelica è anche dovuta alla sua capacità di atterrare dove molti jet non sono in grado. Nel complesso, questo piccolo velivolo possiede le caratteristiche dei grandi jet e offre un'eccellente autonomia ed efficienza nei consumi.\r\n",

Si caratterizza per un aumento del 14% nelle dimensioni dei finestrini rispetto al suo predecessore, il che permette una migliore visione ai passeggeri ed un aumento della luce naturale della cabina di oltre il 30%. Sono stati aggiornati i sistemi di bordo ed il design. Il potenziamento dei motori e l'aggiunta di alette alle estremità alari, che lo rendono facilmente distinguibile dal 604, migliorano le prestazioni dell'aeromobile. Il Challenger 605 offre un'autonomia superiore rispetto al 604 con consumi inferiori. Offre la stessa cabina extra-large con posti per nove 9 passeggeri nel massimo del comfort, i miglioramenti tecnologici per ridurre il rumore in cabina e stabilizzare il volo garantiscono un viaggio silenzioso e tranquillo. Nel complesso, il Challenger 605 ha un aspetto più moderno rispetto al suo predecessore e fornisce un servizio eccellente mantenendo un giusto rapporto tra comfort e prestazioni. \r\n",

      "description": "Il Learjet 40XR è il modello di fascia alta della Bombardier nella categoria Light Jet, fu lanciato nel 2004 come aggiornamento del Learjet 40, con forti miglioramenti per quel che riguarda i motori. Da ciò deriva un netto aumento del rateo di salita che permette di superare rapidamente le quote utilizzate dagli aeromobili di linea. Il 40XR gode inoltre di un considerevole raggio di azione, maggiore di quello del Citation CJ2+ o del Hawker 400XP, ha inoltre la più elevata velocità di crociera di tutti gli aeromobili della sua categoria, incluso il Phenom 300, aeromobile di elevate prestazioni. Alla alta velocità di crociera il Learjet 40XR aggiunge una cabina spaziosa, la più lunga tra i Light Jet, che consente di accogliere facilmente fino a sei passeggeri. Questo aeromobile è quindi caratterizzato da ottimo equilibrio tra prestazioni e confort rappresentando la soluzione ideale per le vostre necessità di viaggi di breve raggio.",

I suoi grandi finestrini, più ampi di quelli di qualsiasi altro velivolo della sua categoria, regaleranno panorami spettacolari e il suo delizioso tavolo da pranzo per sei 6 persone risulta di una particolare ricercatezza. Oltre a un comfort eccezionale, il design razionale e la tecnologia all'avanguardia del Global 7000 si combinano per generare basse emissioni di gas nocivi ed elevate prestazioni.

Il Challenger 300 si caratterizza per una cabina molto spaziosa in cui si può stare in piedi, più grande di quella di molti concorrenti nella stessa categoria di Super Midsize Jet, e offre un ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo. La tipica disposizione è una configurazione Club 4, un divano a tre posti e due posti individuali: il tutto permette il viaggio fino a 9 passeggeri nel comfort più assoluto. Oltre a questo spazio interno confortevole, il 300 fornisce anche un servizio eccellente grazie alle sue elevate prestazioni. E' in grado di offrire un raggio d'azione competitivo di  oltre 5.700 km, ad esempio è in grado di collegare Cannes e Dubai. Estremamente spazioso ed affidabile, il Challenger 300 è particolarmente adatto ai voli di medio raggio. \r\n",

Si caratterizza per la stessa spaziosa cabina del suo predecessore, che consente al passeggero di stare in piedi, ed è considerevolmente più ampia di quella dei suoi rivali, come il Falcon 50 o il Citation X. Il 350 è dotato di un'avionica aggiornata e di sistemi di rilevazione meteorologica che riducono il carico di lavoro del pilota, aumentano l'affidabilità del velivolo, incrementano nettamente la possibilità di evitare turbolenze, migliorando così il comfort dei passeggeri. Inoltre, il Challenger 350 offre un'autonomia maggiore rispetto al 300, grazie ad un miglioramento delle performance dei motori. Nel complesso, la Bombardier ha migliorato un aereo già affermato per realizzare il Challenger 350, offrendo un business jet all'avanguardia in grado di fornire un eccellente servizio. \r\n",

L&#39;M2 possiede anche un&#39;impressionante velocit&agrave; massima di crociera e pu&ograve; volare e pi&ugrave; lontano, rispetto al CJ1+. L&#39;interno dell&#39;M2 ospita fino a 5 passeggeri in una configurazione Club 4 pi&ugrave; un posto a sedere aggiuntivo di fronte alla porta della cabina, e possiede un design nuovo e moderno che lo rende pi&ugrave; spazioso e confortevole.

L'aggiornamento più importante, oltre al comfort della cabina, è dato dalla nuova coppia di motori turbofan di cui l'EX è dotato. Ciò permette all'EX di viaggiare più lontano e più velocemente rispetto al suo predecessore e di raggiungere un'altitudine di crociera più elevata. Il tempo di volo si riduce sensibilmente dal momento che il 2000EX è in grado di volare oltre il traffico aereo commerciale e seguire la rotta più breve. L'altitudine di crociera più elevata consente inoltre all'EX di evitare condizioni meteorologiche potenzialmente perturbate, garantendo un viaggio tranquillo e confortevole. \r\n",

      "description": "Successore del 2000EX, il Falcon 2000LX à stato lanciato nel 2009 ed è dotato di una serie di migliorie in diverse aree in grado di incrementare prestazioni, efficienza e comfort. In primo luogo, i motori aggiornati conferiscono al velivolo un'autonomia maggiore, di quasi 7.500 km, e una maggiore velocità massima di crociera. In secondo luogo, l'LX si caratterizza per ali nuovissime, progettate per ridurre la resistenza fino al 5%, rendendolo più efficiente  rispetto al suo predecessore e a qualsiasi altro aereo della categoria Large Business Jet. Terzo aspetto, la nuova progettazione fa si che l'LX possa offrire uno spazio interno molto più moderno, dotato di un sistema di intrattenimento all'avanguardia, incorpori una tecnologia di ultima generazione per la riduzione del rumore interno e sia dotato di posti a sedere più confortevoli, per un carico massimo di 10 passeggeri. Considerati tutti questi aspetti, la Dassault ha quindi migliorato sotto tutti i punti di vista il precedente modello nel nuovo Falcon 2000LX, un business jet estremamente efficiente e confortevole, in grado di fornire un servizio eccezionale sia che viaggiate per lavoro che per piacere.

      "description": "Il Falcon 2000S è molto simile al fratello Falcon 2000LX dal momento che è costruito con lo stesso design e la stessa struttura, ma causa del range ridotto ed altre caratteristiche appartiene alla categoria dei Super Midsize Jets. Come l'LX, il 2000S offre una cabina spaziosa in cui si può stare in piedi e ospita comodamente fino a 10 passeggeri in una configurazione Club 4 più 6 posti a sedere individuali. La differenza principale tra loro risiede nell'eccezionale prestazione a bassa velocità del 2000S, che possiede l'impronta a minor impatto ambientale dell'intera serie Falcon della Dassault. Queste prestazioni a bassa velocità riducono inoltre la distanza di atterraggio del 2000S a 705 metri: ciò significa che questo jet ha accesso al 50% delle piste in più rispetto ad altri aerei della stessa classe, permettendogli di portarvi presso aeroporti remoti, ma spesso più vicini alla vostra destinazione finale. \r\n",

Consequently, not only does the 2000LXS offer best-in-class fuel efficiency and exceptional range, easily connecting Paris and New York or Dubai and London, but it is also able to access many more airfields than other aircraft in its category, often getting you closer to your final destination. This state-of-the-art business jet is also fitted with the latest entertainment systems and features an incredibly quiet, spacious and modern cabin, which caters for up to 10 passengers. The Falcon 2000LXS brings together intelligent design, class-leading performance and optimized comfort to make it an ideal aircraft for luxury transatlantic travel. ",

Le sue elevate prestazioni sono anche dovute ai tre motori turbofan, oltre  che ad un disegno efficiente ed aerodinamico. Il design non solo aumenta l'efficienza del jet, ma migliora il comfort all'interno della cabina, considerato che le alette alle estremità alari e gli stabilizzatori orizzontali garantiscono un volo più tranquillo e rilassante. Questo jet di lungo raggio si caratterizza anche per una cabina accogliente che ospita fino a 14 passeggeri nel massimo comfort e per una tecnologia relativa alla cabina ultramoderna tale da rendere il vostro volo divertente e piacevole. Considerati tutti questi aspetti, il 7X risulta un aeromobile veramente di altissimo livello efficiente ed in grado di fornire un ottimo servizio. \r\n",

I miglioramenti del motore, i perfezionamenti aerodinamici e un aumento della capacità del serbatoio carburante conferiscono all'8X un'autonomia eccezionale, considerevolmente superiore rispetto al 7X, e ancora migliore rispetto al Global 6000 della Bombardier. Ciò permetterà al Falcon 8X di effettuare voli  come Parigi-Singapore e New York-Pechino ad un'elevata velocità di crociera, portandovi a destinazione con tempi di volo di volo eccezionali. L'aereo è dotato di una tecnologia all'avanguardia che gli conferisce una particolare efficienza,   di sistemi di stabilizzazione e rilevazione delle condizioni meteorologiche in grado di permettere un viaggio tranquillo. La spaziosa cabina è più lunga di quella del Falcon 7X e ospita fino a 15 passeggeri garantendo loro un volo ancora più confortevole e piacevole in una delle diverse e svariate configurazioni possibili. La Dassault non ha rinunciato a nulla nella progettazione del Falcon 8X, che è un Long Range Jet le cui prestazioni estremamente elevate vanno di pari passo con uno suo spazio di cabina ottimizzato.\r\n",

Anche se è classificato come un Super Midsize Jet, il Falcon 5X supera ampiamente le normali aspettative di un aereo della sua categoria, sotto ogni punto di vista. La cabina è più spaziosa rispetto a molti Large Jet e Super Large Jet e, con oltre 2 metri di altezza, è più alto del Lineage 1000, aeromobile di linea, versione VIP, dell'Embraer . Si caratterizzerà anche per un interno moderno ed elegante, compreso un finestrino posizionato sulla parte superiore della cabina, una prima assoluta su un business jet, così come per un sistema di intrattenimento all'avanguardia e una tecnologia di stabilizzazione del volo atta a garantire un volo tranquillo e piacevole. In questo aereo di lusso potranno viaggiare fino a 14 passeggeri. Anche le prestazioni promesse sono eccezionali: un'autonomia ai vertici della categoria e una velocità di crociera che rivaleggia e spesso sorpassa quella dei Super Large Jet. Grazie alla combinazione di particolare spaziosità, prestazioni e design, il Falcon 5X è uno dei Business Jet più attesi all'orizzonte e, se sarà all'altezza delle aspettative e manterrà quanto anticipato dalla Dassault, è destinato a divenire uno standard di riferimento per i viaggi con jet privati di alta gamma.\r\n",

It was first launched in 1984 as a development of Dassault&rsquo;s Falcon 50, providing a larger interior, while still being powered by three turbo-fan engines. When it was first produced, the Falcon 900 was known for its long-range capabilities and the aircraft is able to accommodate up to 14 passengers, depending on seating configuration. The original Falcon 900 has been upgraded time and time again, which has succeeded in maintaining the range&rsquo;s popularity and the most recent model, the 900LX, combines excellent speed, efficiency and range to offer an exceptional overall performance.",

Dassault designed the 900EX with more modern avionics, upgraded engines and greater fuel capacity to provide it with a maximum range of over 5,000 miles. As with the whole Falcon 900 range, the 900EX offers an extremely comfortable and spacious cabin that can be partitioned into 3 separate sections. The 900EX has the capacity to accommodate up to 14 passengers but is usually configured to cater for 12 in a double Club 4 arrangement, 3-seater sofa and an individual seat.",

Il Fokker 50 è anche più spazioso rispetto a molti altri velivoli della sua categoria, compreso il Dornier 328 e il Saab 340, e offre un servizio più confortevole. Come tutti i turboelica, questo aereo non possiede la velocità massima di crociera e l'autonomia di un jet. Tuttavia, il Fokker 50 possiede una discreta autonomia, per un velivolo del suo tipo, di oltre 2.000 km., e vola più lontano rispetto ai rivali Dornier e Saab. Tutto considerato, il mix di spazio e prestazioni rendono questo velivolo attrattivo per voli di breve raggio effettuati da gruppi numerosi.\r\n",

Il G350 pertanto possiede la stessa superficie del G450 ma, non godendo della stessa autonomia, è disponibile a un prezzo inferiore. Con la capacità di volare per oltre 7.000 km senza scalo, il G350 è comunque in grado di effettuare voli intercontinentali ed è particolarmente veloce, più rapido dei suoi competitori diretti il Challenger 605 ed il Legacy 600. I finestrini caratteristici della  Gulfstream garantiscono alla spaziosa cabina una particolare luminosità, l'interno dotato fino a 12 posti è fornito di una  cucina di bordo attrezzata. Il G350 presenta anche una bassa quota di pressurizzazione in grado di ridurre la fatica del viaggio e garantire ai i passeggeri di arrivare a destinazione più riposati. Veloce, spazioso e confortevole, il G350 è un'eccellente soluzione alle vostre necessità di voli di medio raggio.  \r\n",

The GIII offers a largely improved performance thanks to an overall redesign, including the increase of the length of the wings and the addition of 5-foot winglets, serving to reduce drag and increase efficiency. Consequently, the GIII achieves a significantly greater range than its predecessor, while maintaining the exceptional reliability for which Gulfstream aircraft are renowned. The GIII features an extremely spacious stand-up cabin, that typically caters to 12-14 passengers in its executive seating configuration but certain variations can accommodate up to 19. Excelling in every department, from comfort to performance, the GIII is a first-rate business jet that is still capable of providing an excellent service.",

Può quindi collegare New York a Doha, Parigi a Singapore o Shanghai a Ginevra e può farlo con tempi di volo ridotti grazie all'eccellente velocità massima di crociera. Questo jet non viene apprezzato solo per le sue prestazioni, ma anche per il suo interno spazioso, che si caratterizza per 3 aree salotto separate che accolgono fino a 14 passeggeri nel comfort più assoluto. Il G550 è dotato di una tecnologia di riduzione del rumore all'avanguardia e dei 14 caratteristici finestrini ovali per offrire una cabina silenziosa e luminosa. Il sistema di pressurizzazione, riduce a zero la ricircolazione dell'aria, offrendo aria nuova al 100%,  e garantisce un altitudine massima della cabina di 6.000 piedi riducendo così gli effetti della fatica del viaggio e del jet lag. Nel complesso, con il G550 la Gulfstream ha creato un jet di alta gamma, in grado non solo di portarvi in aeroporti più lontani ed da una velocità superiore, ma anche di permettervi di arrivare a destinazione più riposati.\r\n",

      "description": "Il G450 à stato messo in servizio nel 2004 per sostituire i modelli GIV e GIV-SP. Nonostante sia più piccolo del G550, appartiene alla stessa categoria di Super Large Jet. Come tutti i membri della famiglia Gulfstream, il G450 è un aereo dalle prestazioni elevate, estremamente veloce e con una ottima autonomia. Per esempio, è in grado di effettuare voli diretti da Ginevra a New York in molto meno tempo rispetto ad un Super Large Business Jet medio. Nonostante le elevate velocità e potenza del motore, la cabina rimane tranquilla e confortevole. L'interno spazioso ospita fino a 13 passeggeri in tre aree salotto separate e la cucina di bordo nella zona posteriore offre una ristorazione VIP durante il volo. Nel complesso, la Gulfstream,  con il G450 combina prestazioni e lusso, per portarvi alla vostra destinazione in modo veloce e nel massimo comfort. ",

      "description": "Gulfstream launched the GIV in 1985 as a much-upgraded and larger version of the GIII. The GIV&rsquo;s intelligent design, stylish exterior and powerful engines help to explain the aircraft&rsquo;s popularity and why its production lasted nearly 20 years, during which time it succeeded in setting over 50 world records for round-the-world flights. The GIV&rsquo;s impressive range, reliability and overall performance, along with its large stand-up cabin mean that, unlike its predecessors, it is categorised as a Super Large Jet. The spacious interior typically accommodates 14 passengers in optimum comfort but, in certain configurations, the GIV can seat up to 19. Gulfstream&rsquo;s most recent aircraft, including the G450, G550 and G650, are all modelled from the original GIV, a true testament to an aircraft that set the standard in its class for so many years.",

The aircraft features the same engines as the GIV, a vast improvement on those of the GIII, as they are not only more powerful but also quieter, providing a considerably more comfortable journey. The GIV-SP boasts a higher maximum cruise speed than the GIV, which greatly reduces journey time, especially when combined with its increased high-altitude performance, enabling it to more easily avoid commercial air traffic. The GIV-SP also has greater take-off and landing weight limits than its predecessor and an upgraded avionics system. It features the same spacious stand-up cabin as the GIV, comfortably seating 14 passengers in its typical executive configuration but with the capacity for up to 19 in certain variants.",

Il risultato è stato  un aereo di successo, il primo dei Super Midsize Business Jet  di \"nuova generazione\". Il G200 ha goduto di una eccezionale affidabilità tecnica pari al 99,75% dal 2001 al 2011, e durante tale periodo sono stati assemblati oltre 150 velivoli. Gli interni di lusso del G200 corrispondono alle dimensioni del Challenger 300, ben maggiori di un Falcon 50 e o di un Citation X, ma, a differenza del Challenger 300, questo velivolo non sacrifica la velocità per lo spazio della cabina. Il G200 non solo è veloce, ma offre anche una migliore autonomia rispetto ai suoi rivali, è in grado di effettuare voli da Ginevra a Dubai. La spaziosa cabina permette fino a 9 passeggeri in posti standard e offre una connessione WIFI  oltre ad una cucina  collocata nella parte posteriore della cabina. Considerati tutti questi aspetti, il G200 risulta un ottimo mix, combinando prestazioni e comfort per fornire un servizio eccellente per voli di medio raggio. \r\n",

Questo Super Midsize Jet, oltre che per il nome, ha catturato l'attenzione globale, sin dal suo lancio nel 2012, per le sue prestazioni eccezionali. Ha infatti un'eccellente autonomia di oltre 6.600 km, superiore ai rivali Cessna, Bombardier e Hawker, ed è estremamente veloce, ha anche stabilito una serie di record di collegamenti tra città. La Gulfstream ritiene che il G280 sia il più efficiente aeromobile nella sua categoria e ritiene il comfort della sua cabina senza eguali. L'interno del G280 non solo è più grande e spazioso rispetto ai concorrenti, ospita fino a 9 passeggeri in una configurazione Club 4, con un divano da tre posti e due posti a sedere aggiuntivi, ma offre anche una tecnologia avanzata per ridurre il rumore in cabina. Il G280 rappresenta veramente una perfetta combinazione di stile e sostanza e fornisce il miglior servizio rispetto a  qualsiasi altro velivolo della sua categoria. \r\n",

Il 400XP è sempre stato molto popolare nel mercato statunitense ed è stato particolarmente ben accettato nel mercato europeo, sin dal suo lancio nel 2010. Ciò è principalmente dovuto al suo spazio interno eccezionale che presenta una cabina più lunga e più larga rispetto a quella dei Cessna Citation CJ1, 2 e 3, ed è in grado di trasportare 7 passeggeri in una configurazione Club 4 più 3 posti a sedere individuali.

Anche se il Premier 1A è classificato come un Light Jet, la larghezza e l'altezza della cabina sono maggiori rispetto a quella di altri Super Light Jet, per esempio del Learjet 45XR. Di conseguenza, il Premier 1A è un jet estremamente spazioso che ospita facilmente fino a 6 passeggeri in una configurazione Club 4 più 2 posti a sedere individuali aggiuntivi. L'interno particolare di questo aereo è largamente dovuto alla sua fusoliera composita in un pezzo unico, che permette al Premier 1A di offrire un'autonomia discreta e una buona velocità massima di crociera. Questa combinazione di prestazioni e comfort rende il Premier 1A un aereo molto noto e una ottima scelta per voli di breve raggio. \r\n",

Il risultato è notevole considerato che l'850XP offre un'ottima autonomia e velocità massima di crociera, ed è inoltre molto efficiente.

Con il 750, l'Hawker Beechcraft ha modificato la serie di aerei Hawker 800, leader a livello mondiale, per produrre un jet più piccolo con una capacità del serbatoio carburante ridotta per permettere  un maggiore spazio per i bagagli. Quindi questo modello offre un'autonomia inferiore rispetto ad altri velivoli più grandi della famiglia Hawker, ma rimane comunque estremamente competitivo nella sua categoria, essendo in grado di effettuare voli senza scalo più lunghi rispetto al Citation XLS+ e al Learjet 45XR. Questo velivolo offre inoltre anche una confortevole cabina fino ad 8 posti, che permette di stare in piedi, considerevolmente più spaziosa rispetto a quella del Learjet 45XR. L'Hawker 750 offre un equilibro tra alte prestazioni e un interno di ottima qualità: il risultato è un eccellente Super Light Jet.\r\n",

Il modello 1000 gode di un'autonomia simile a quella del Challenger 300 che, pur essendo inferiore a quella eccezionale del G280, è comunque  in grado di effettuare viaggi intercontinentali. L'Hawker 1000 offre quindi una prestazione e comfort della cabina discreti, ed è estremamente affidabile. Inoltre, questo aereo è spesso un'eccellente opzione in quanto si trova sul mercato a prezzi nettamente competitivi rispetto alla maggior parte degli altri Super Midsize Jet, in particolare dei rivali Gulfstream e Dassault. \r\n",

La sua costruzione con materiali compositi avanzati permette all'Hawker 4000 di offrire un servizio di elevate prestazioni e di eccezionale efficienza. Il 4000 è in grado di salire a 41.000 piedi in meno di 19 minuti, superando velocemente il traffico aereo e condizioni meteorologiche potenzialmente perturbate. Questo aeromobile è anche apprezzato per le sue prestazioni ad elevate altitudini, ha un'autonomia di oltre 6.000 km, e vola ad  una velocità massima di crociera di circa 900 km/h, portando i suoi passeggeri verso destinazioni lontane con tempi di volo ridotti. L'interno è spazioso e luminoso, grazie a 7 ampi finestrini su ciascun lato, e può ospitare fino a 8 passeggeri, in una tipica configurazione di  Club 4 doppia. E'dotato anche di uno scomparto bagagli pressurizzato, accessibile durante il volo. Nel complesso, questo aereo Super Midsize confortevole ed efficiente risulta molto apprezzato e frequentemente consigliato. \r\n",

Il primo HondaJet di produzione ha effettuato il suo volo inaugurale il 1 luglio 2014, a partire da quella data sono stati riportati dalla stampa più di 100 ordini. L'Hondajet è il jet più grande della sua categoria,  ospita 5 passeggeri in una cabina spaziosa garantendo un volo di breve raggio confortevole. Il suo design innovativo combina tecnologie e concetti avanzati, dando vita a un velivolo che non è solo bello da vedere, ma è anche il jet più veloce e il più efficiente della sua classe, e ciò è in parte dovuto al posizionamento del motore sopra l'ala. Honda promette che il suo VLJ sopravanzerà i suoi rivali anche nell'autonomia, e che sarà sicuramente in grado di effettuare voli intra-europei, come Parigi-Ibiza o Ginevra-Berlino. \r\n",

Sono state introdotte  una serie di modifiche interne ed esterne, mantenendo la spaziosa cabina dell'Hawker, molto larga ed alta per un aereo appartenente alla categoria Light Jet. Gli interni sono stati modificati rendendolo il jet più silenzioso della sua classe grazie al nuovo sistema di isolamento acustico, mentre, come il suo predecessore, può ospitare comodamente fino a 6 passeggeri nella configurazione Club 4 più 2 posti a sedere individuali. All'esterno, l'aggiornamento include miglioramenti aerodinamici, un nuovo sistema di fissaggio dei motori e una coppia di motori turbo fan più moderni. Di conseguenza, il 400XT ha una grande autonomia,   ed è particolarmente veloce ed efficiente, con costi operativi ridotti. Nel complesso, la Nextant ha avuto successo nell'aggiungere prestazioni all'avanguardia ad una cabina già molto apprezzata e al top della gamma, per realizzare un Light Jet particolarmente adatto ai viaggi d'affari o ai rapidi spostamenti  del fine settimana.

Il suo design italiano è veramente unico, rispetto a qualsiasi altro turboprop sul mercato, e questo lo rende particolarmente conosciuto. Non è solo lo stile dell'Avanti che colpisce: ma anche le sue prestazioni particolarmente elevate infatti vola molto più lontano e più veloce rispetto a qualsiasi altro Turboprop. La sua velocità e autonomia sono tali da competere con quelle di alcuni jet leggeri ma i consumi sono ridotti di quasi il 40% rispetto alla maggior parte dei business jet. L'interno assomiglia a un jet di una categoria diversa, di maggior valore, grazie alla sua cabina silenziosa, più larga e più alta qualsiasi altro velivolo della categoria Cessna CJ. Questa combinazione di elevate prestazioni e comfort, senza paragoni per un aereo di questa classe, fanno sì che Avanti II abbia un eccezionale rapporto qualità-prezzo. \r\n",

La Pilatus sostiene che il PC-24 sarà veramente unico grazie alle sue eccezionali prestazioni su piste corte ed alla capacità di operare su piste non asfaltate e su piste in erba, offrendo all'aeromobile la possibilità di accedere a oltre 21.000 piste che altri jet non possono utilizzare (solo ad uso privato non utilizzabili come charter secondo la normativa prevista per voli commerciali). Il PC-24 avrà anche una elevata autonomia in linea con quelle del Phenom 300 o del CJ4.\r\nOltre a performance eccezionali, il PC-24 promette di offrire lo spazio di cabina ed il comfort space di un Jet Mid Size al prezzo di un Light Jet. Il PC-24 presenterà la più lunga e larga cabina per un aeromobile della stessa categoria ed il più grande volume per le stiva bagagli, accessibile tramite una porta cargo di grandi dimensioni. \r\nDati i molti ordini già ricevuti per il PC-24, è chiaro che la Pilatus è riuscita a convincere l'industria che il proprio nuovissimo Light Jet sarà in grado di offrire ai passeggeri un servizio di altissimo livello in grado di bilanciare perfettamente  performance e comfort.

Számtalan előnnyel jár, hogy az ilyen tágas utastér mellett az ACJ318 Elite a hosszabb repülőgépek számára nem hozzáférhető repülőtereken - mint például London Cityben - is képes leszállni.

Úgy tervezték, hogy optimalizálják az elrendezést kategóriavezető belső terében, a King Air 350i a legkorszerűbb technológiát alkalmazza a törzs és hajtóművek vibrációja által keltett zaj csökkentésére, új szabványt hozva létre a turbólégcsavaros repülőgépek utasterének zajmentességére. Ez a repülőgép szintén képes rövid kifutópályákon leszállni, így kis repülőterekre is eljuthat, amelyek gyakran közelebb találhatóak célállomásainkhoz. A repülőgép hosszú kabinja 4-4 egymással szembeni (dupla Club 4) elrendezésben 8 utas elhelyezésére alkalmas. Nyomás alatt lévő csomagtere fűtött és teljes mértékben hozzáférhető repülés közben. További csomagok a repülőgép külső tárolóiban szállíthatók. A rendkívül kényelmes utastér mellett a King Air dícséretet érdemel nagy teljesítményéért és páratlan üzemanyag hatékonyságáért, amelynek köszönhető alacsony az üzemeltetési költsége. Messzebbre eljuttatni az utasokat kevesebb üzemanyaggal, nagyszerű áron; ez az, ami a King Air 350i-t tökéletes választássá teszi bármely reptér elérésére is legyen a cél rövidtávú repüléseiknél.",

A King Air 90 GTx-et 2009 júliusában bocsátották útjára éveken átívelő sorozatos fejlesztéseket követően. A C90GTi felváltására tervezték. A karcsú szárnyvégek hozzáadása javítja emelkedési képességét és utazási sebességét, valamint növeli üzemanyag hatékonyságát és teljesítményét. Hatótávolsága több mint 20 százalékkal nőtt, így most a korábbiaknál messzebbre tudja utasait eljuttatni - ez akár 1600 tengeri mérföld távolságot jelenthet nagy sebesség mellett négy felnőttel a fedélzeten. Bár ez a repülőgép a King Air sorozat legkisebbje, akkor is kényelmes elhelyezést biztosít, ha 5 utassal repül. A pilótafülkét a legkorszerűbb turbulencia-észlelő és olyan repülőelektronikai rendszerekkel látták el, amelyeket általában csak nagyobb és jóval drágább repülőgépeken találhatunk meg. Tovább növeli ennek a nagyszerű turbólégcsavaros repülőgépnek a vonzerejét az a képessége, hogy ott is le tud szállni, ahol sok sugárhajtású repülőgép nem. Összességében ez a kicsi repülőgép tele van a nagyobb repülőgépek tulajdonságaival, kiváló hatótávolságot és üzemanyag takarékosságot kínál.",

Számtalan előnnyel jár, hogy az ilyen tágas utastér mellett az ACJ318 Elite a hosszabb repülőgépek számára nem hozzáférhető repülőtereken - mint például London Cityben - is képes leszállni. Az ACJ318 fényűző belseje könnyű elhelyezést biztosít 18 utasnak a 4 külön részre osztott utastérben, ahol társalgók és egy privát szoba is megtalálható, utóbbi irodaként és kényelmes hálószobaként is használható.

      "description": "A Global 7000 szolgálatba lépésének pontos dátuma továbbra is bizonytalan, bár a mostani várakozások szerint az 2016-ban lesz. Ennek ellenére kevéssé meglepő, hogy 2010-es Atlantában tartott bemutatása óta mennyire sok rendelés érkezett a Global 7000-re, mivel egyedülálló utastere páratlanul tágas, 4 egymástól elkülönített társas térből áll. Csodálatos kilátást biztosító, óriási ablakai nagyobbak, mint kategóriájában bármely másik gépé. Remekbeszabott hatszemélyes ebédlőasztala árasztja magából a luxust. Optimális kényelme mellett a Global 7000 mindent figyelembe vevő tervezése és legmagasabb színvonalat képviselő technológiája együtt alacsony károsanyag-kibocsátást és nagy teljesítményt tesz lehetővé. Ez a nagy hatótávolságú sugárhajtású repülőgép kényelmes, otthont idéző légkörben képes utasait olyan nagyvárosok között leszállás nélkül szállítani, mint London és Szingapúr vagy New York és Dubai.",

Ezt azt jelenti, hogy ez a repülőgép 13 utast lesz képes elszállítani Los Angeles-ből Sydney-be vagy Hong Kong-ból New York-ba. A Global 8000 azonban nemcsak páratlanul nagyobb hatótávolságával fogja remény vesztetté tenné a versenytársakat, hanem a hihetetlen luxussal felszerelt belső térrel is, amely garantálni fogja minden utas számára a pihentető repülést, aludjon akár a kényelmes ágyak valamelyikében, nézzen egy filmet az óriási képernyőn vagy gyönyörködjön a kilátásban repülőgép hatalmas ablakain keresztül.

      "description": "1997-től 2006-ig tartó gyártásának ideje alatt a Cessna Citation Bravo az egyik legnépszerűbb és legsikeresebb könnyű üzleti célú sugárhajtású repülőgép volt a piacon. Ebből a megbízhatóságáról híres változatból még mai is több mint 300 üzemel. A Bravo kellemes belterű, 4,8 m hosszú utasteret kapott. Annak ellenére, hogy nem manapság tervezték, a Bravoban 7 utas is kényelmesen elfér, négy egymással szemben (Club 4), három pedig egyéni ülésekben. Kényelmi szolgáltatásaik optimalizálása érdekében a ma üzemelő Bravo-k közül már sokat felújítottak. Ez a repülőgép jól szolgál a nagyobb európai városok közötti gyors összeköttetés biztosításában, s mivel meredek megközelítésekre is alkalmas, ezért olyan repülőtereken is le tud szállni, mint London City vagy Lugano. Összefoglalva, bár ez a könnyű kategóriás sugárhajtású repülőgép nem a legújabb Cessna-k közül való, még mindig kiváló szolgálatot teljesít a rövid távú (mintegy 3 órás) útvonalakon.",

A Citation XLS+ képes a legnagyobb távolságok megtételére az Excel sorozatú nagyon könnyű kategóriás repülőgépek közül, leszállás nélkül képes 3500 kilométer repülni. Rendkívül tágas utastere 8 főt képes elhelyezni 6 különálló ülésben és egy kétszemélyes kanapén a gép elülső részén. Az XLS+ nagy utazósebességgel rendelkezik és nagyobb gépek számára nem hozzáférhető, rövid kifutópályákon is leszállhat, amelyek gyakran közelebb helyezkednek el úticéljainkhoz. Hatékony, kényelmes és célirányos: A Cessna Excel sorozatának legújabb modellje ideális rövid távú repülésekhez és különösen kedvelt az Európán belüli üzleti utakra és hétvégi kirándulásokra.",

Bár ez az elismerés most már a Gulfstream G650-et illeti, a Citation X még mindig rendkívül gyors, sokkal gyorsabb, mint bármely más repülőgép a a prémium+ (super-midsize) magánrepülőgépek között. Több mint 5600 kilométeres hatótávolságával a Citation X interkontinentális utazásokra is alkalmas, leszállás nélkül repülhet például Dubaiból Nizzába. Ez a kiváló teljesítmény a 2 igen erős Rolls-Royce hajtóműnek és a repülőgép intelligens tervezési jellemzőinek köszönhető, mint például a típsura jellemző szárnyprofil és szárnyvégek. A Citation X belső tere stílusos és korszerű, minden kényelmet megad, ami egy modern magánrepülőgéptől elvárható. A tágas utastérben 8 fő foglalhat helyet kényelmesen két egymással szembeni (Club 4) elrendezésben. Mindez biztosítja, hogy a Citation X kivételes teljesítménye élvezetes és pihentető repülési élménnyel párosul.",

A Cessna hitt abban, hogy egy piaci rést találtak a magán bérlésű járatok területén, és ha a Mustang sikere ennek megítélésében mértékadónak tekinthető, akkor igazuk is volt. 2005 óta több mint 350 darabot gyártottak és szállítottak le üzemeltetőiknek ebből a kicsi, de rendkívül népszerű sugárhajtású repülőgépből és erre a verseny kihívásra mind az Embraer mind a Honda saját hasonló  repülőgép kibocsátásával reagált. Bár gépeik kismértékben nagyobbak, de a Mustang utasterében is kényelmesen elhelyezkedhet 4 utas. Ez a repülőgép mindemellett rendkívül jó ár-érték aránnyal rendelkezik, gyakran ez a piacon található leginkább megfizethető sugárhajtású repülőgép, amelynek ára sokszor még a turbólégcsavaros repülőgépek áránál is alacsonyabb. Mindent figyelembe véve a Mustang tökéletesen alkalmas Európán belüli rövidtávú repülésekre, egy napon belüli oda-vissza üzleti utakra, és hétvégi kirándulásokra.",

Kényelmesebb és korszerűbb beltérben max. 10 utast szállít, ami növeli a repülési élményt. Az utastér kényelme mellett a legfontosabb frissítés, amellyel az EX-et ellátták azok a dupla turbóventillátoros gázturbinás hajtóművek. Ezek teszik lehetővé, hogy az EX elődjénél távolabbra és gyorsabban repüljön s egyúttal nagyobb utazási magasságot érhessen el. Ez nagyban lerövidíti az utazási időt, mert a 2000EX a kereskedelmi légi forgalom felett repülve a lehető legközvetlenebb útvonalat választhatja. A nagyobb utazási magasság azt is jelenti, hogy az EX ki tud térni a rossz időjárás elől és így utasainak sima és kényelmes utazásban lehet része.",

A gépet számos olyan fejlesztéssel látták el, amelyek együttesen megnövelt teljesítményt, hatékonyságot és kényelmet nyújtanak. Elsőként ki kell emelni a továbbfejlesztett hajtóművek által kínált megnövelt, majdnem 7500 kilométeres hatótávolságot és nagyobb maximális utazósebességet. Másodikként kell említeni az LX vadonatúj szárnyait, amelyeket a légellenállás max. 5 százalékkal történő csökkentésére terveztek és amelyek a gépet elődjénél, sőt kategóriájában minden más nagy üzleti sugárhajtású repülőgépnél sokkal üzemanyag hatékonyabbá teszik. Harmadsorban modernebb repülőgépként az LX sokkal korszerűbb utasteret kínál csúcskategóriájú szórakoztatórendszerrel, zajcsökkentő technológiával és 10 utas számára a korábbiaknál kényelmesebb ülésekkel. Mindent figyelembe véve a gyárató Dassault a Falcon 2000LX megalkotásakor a 2000EX minden részét átdolgozta egy rendkívül hatékony és kényelmes vállalati sugárhajtású repülőgéppé, amely kivételes szolgáltatást nyújt, legyen szó akár üzleti, akár magánutazásról.",

      "description": "A Falcon 2000S nagyon hasonlít testvér repülőgépéhez, a Falcon 2000LX-hez, mivel azonos tervek alapján azonos szerkezet köré épült, s ezért mindkettő az exkluzív (large) kategóriájú repülőgépekhez tartoznak. Csakúgy mint az LX, a 2000S is tágas, felegyenesedést is lehetővé tevő utasteret kínál, amelyben 10 utas helyezkedhet el kényelmesen, az egymással szemben elhelyezett 4 (Club 4) és 6 egyéni ülés elrendezésben. A két gép közötti legfőbb különbség a 2000S alacsony sebességen mutatott rendkívüli teljesítménye, amelynek köszönhetően ez a gép egyrészt a Dassault teljes Falcon sorozatának \"legzöldebb\" (legkörnyezetbarátabb) modellje, másrészt ez az alacsony sebességen mutatott teljesítmény mindössze 705 méterre csökkenti a 2000S számára szükséges leszálló távolságot. Ez azt jelenti, hogy ennek a sugárhajtású repülőgépnek az osztálya más tagjai által igényelt leszállópálya hosszának a fele is elegendő így távolabbi repülőtereket is igénybe vehet, hiszen rövidebb leszállópályákra is el tudja juttatni Önt, amelyek így közelebb lehetnek a célállomáshoz. Bár hasonlít az LX-hez, ez a fontos különbség sorolja be a Falcon 2000S-t a sorozat összes többi tagjától és minden más kategóriájába tartozó repülőgéptől különálló osztályba.",

      "description": "A 7X-et üzleti sugárhajtású sorozatának meghatározó gépeként mutatta be a Dassault 2005-ben. Ez a repülő a Falcon család csúcsát képviseli, hiszen nem csak a leggyorsabb, de több mint 11 ezer kilóméterrel a legnagyobb hatótávolságú is egyben . A nagy teljesítmény részben a 7X-et meghajtó három ultramodern sugárhajtóműnek köszönhető, csakúgy mint a repülőgép intelligens, letisztult tervezésének. A külső kialakítása nemcsak a repülőgép hatékonyságát, hanem egyben az utastéren belüli kényelmet is növeli minthogy karcsú szárnyvégek és vízszintes stabilizátorok gondoskodnak a sima és pihentető repülési élményről. Ennek a nagy hatótávú sugárhajtású repülőgépnek az utastere 14 fő számára biztosít maximális kényelmet és kitűnő fedélzeti kiszolgáló és szórakóztató rendszerek teszik a repülést élvezetessé. Mindent figyelembe véve a 7X fényűző, hatékony és kiváló szolgáltatást nyújt.",

      "description": "A Falcon család hosszú ideje várt legújabb tagja, az első sorozatgyártott Dassault 8X várhatóan 2016 végére kerül ki a gyárból. A Falcon sorozat legújabb \"zászlóshajója\" az 7X-hez hasonlóan nagy hatótávolságú sugárhajtású, minden tekintetben kiemelkedő, csúcskategóriás repülőgép. A továbbfejlesztett hajtóműnek, az aerodinamikai finomításoknak és a megnövelt üzemanyagtartály-kapacitásnak köszönhetően az 8X még az 7X-es modellét, sőt a Bombardier Global 6000-res típusáét is meghaladó, szinte hihetetlen hatótávolsággal rendelkezik. Mindezek révén a Falcon 8X képes nagy utazósebességgel, különösen rövid idő alatt eljutni például Párizsból Szingapúrba, vagy New Yorkból Pekingbe. A repülőgépet a legkorszerűbb technológiai berendezésekkel gyártják, üzemanyag-felhasználásának hatékonysága igazán lenyűgöző, időjárás-érzékelő és stabilizáló berendezései pedig a lehető legkényelmesebb utazásról gondoskodnak. A tágas utastér hossza meghaladja a Falcon 7X modellét, így akár 15 utas is még kényelmesebben és kellemesebben utazhat a gép különféleképpen elrendezhető ülésein. A Falcon 8X megtervezése és gyártása során a Dassault semmiféle kompromisszumot nem kötött, így olyan hosszú hatótávolságú sugárhajtású repülőgépet hozott létre, amelynek rendkívüli teljesítményéhez csupán a legfinomabb részletekig kidolgozott belső tere mérhető.

Ugyanazokat a szárnyakat kapta, mint elődje, de sokkal szélesebb és hosszabb törzse hasonlóvá teszi az utastér méretét a 7X-éhez, mely a Dassault Falcon sorozatának meghatározó típusa. 2005-ben állt forgalomba és elődjével megegyező szárnyainak használatával is sokkal szélesebb és hosszabb törzse a Falcon 7X, a  Falcon sorozata zászlóshajójához hasonló méretű utasteret foglal magába. Ennek a repülőgépnek sokféle adaptációja létezik: a 900, 900B és a 900C korábbi változatok, a 900EX egy régebbi, míg a 900LX a legújabb hosszú távú repülésekre alkalmas változat. Bár a DX a nagy hatótávú besorolás helyett az exkluzív+ (super-large) méretű kategóriába tartozik, még így is képes megtenni a Párizs - Chicago útvonalat a figyelemreméltó 878 km/h utazósebességgel. Csodálatos utaskabinja három elkülönített szekcióra van osztva, nappali konfigurációban 13 utasnak biztosít ülőhelyet, míg éjszaka 7 utas aludhat kényelmes ágyakban. A repülőgépen minde kategóriájától elvárható minden kényelmi felszerelés megtalálható, ideértve a gép elején lévő komplett konyhát.",

Számos továbbfejlesztés történt, mint például az újratervezett szárnyak, három új gázturbinás hajtómű, ami megnövelte a gép teljesítményét, különös figyelemmel az üzemanyag hatékonyságra és a 8800 kilométerre megnövekedett hatótávra.  Ezek a fejlesztések a jól felismerhető, hatékonnyá alakított szárnyvégekkel együtt magyarázatot adnak mind   a Bombardier Challenger 850-nél, mind a Global 5000-nél nagyobb maximális utazósebességére is. Ez a repülőgép is, mint a 900DX- a kiemelkedően nagy méretű üzleti kategóriába sorolható, ugyanúgy kifejezetten széles és hosszú, méretében hasonló törzsel rendelkezik, mint a típusvezető  Falcon 7X. A korszerű belső tér három egymástól elválasztott részre osztott, 13 utas számára elegendő ülőhellyel, mely tágas és fényűző, felszerelve WIFI-vel és MP3 rendszerrel az élményt nyújtó utazás érdekében. Kényelmesen és hatékonyan kapcsolhat össze olyan nagyvárosokat, mint Párizs és Peking vagy New York és Moszkva, a Falcon 900LX fantasztikus választás repülőútjaihoz.",

Jóllehet a repülőgépet a prémium+ (super-midsize) kategóriába sorolják, a Falcon 5X minden területen túlszárnyalja a kategóriájába tartozó riválisokkal szemben általában támasztott követelményeket. Utastere számos exkluzív large és super-large kategóriájú gépénél is tágasabb és a 2 métert meghaladó belmagassága az Embraer Lineage 1000 VIP modelljének belmagasságánál is nagyobb. A gép ízléses, korszerű beltéri kialakításának kiemelkedő elemei közé tartozik a magánrepülőgépek kategóriájában elsőként alkalmazott mennyezeti ablak, továbbá a lehető legkorszerűbb szórakoztató rendszer, a sima és élvezetes utazást biztosító stabilizációs technológia. Akár 14 utas is utazhat egy időben ezen a luxuskategóriás gépen, amelynek teljesítménymutatói is kiválónak ígérkeznek. Kategóriájában vezető hatótávolsága és utazó sebessége eléri, sőt esetenként meg is haladja az exkluzív kategóriájú super-large sugárhajtású repülőgépekét. Rendkívüli tágassága, teljesítménye és kialakítása révén a Falcon 5X az egyik legnagyobb izgalommal várt Üzleti Sugárhajtású Repülőgép, amely, ha megfelel a várakozásoknak és teljesíti a Dassault ígéreteit, elkerülhetetlenül a csúcskategóriás privát sugárhajtású légiközlekedés zsinórmértékévé válik.

A Falcon 50EX rendkívül könnyen felismerhető három hátul elhelyezett gázturbinás hajtóművéről, amely elrendezés a repülőgép sima, áramvonalas tervezésével együtt stílusos üzleti repülőgépet eredményezett. Az 50EX természetesen nem csak stílus tartalom nélkül: tekintve a rövid-fel- és leszállási teljesítményét, tiszteletreméltó hatótávolságát és sok versenytársánál - például a Bombardier Challenger 300 - nagyobb maximális utazósebességét. Annak ellenére, hogy a Dassault privát sugárhajtású repülőgépei közül a legrövidebb az utastere, az 50EX így is kényelmes ülőhelyet biztosít 9 utasnak. Összességében, a Falcon 50EX- szel a Dassault egy rendkívül hatékony üzleti sugárhajtású repülőgépet alkotott, amely ideális közepes távolságú repülési útvonalak megtételére.",

Kiváló maximális utazósebességének köszönhetően így tudja nagyszerű időn belül összekötni New York-ot Doha-val, Párizst Szingapúrral vagy Shanghai-t Genf-fel . Ezt a sugárhajtású repülőgépet nemcsak nagy teljesítményéért illeti dicséret, hanem tágas belső teréért is, amely 3 egymástól elválasztott kabinszekcióra van osztva és 14 utast képes elhelyezni a legnagyobb kényelemben. A csendes és világos belső tér érdekében a repülőgép az elérhető legkorszerűbb zajcsökkentő technológiával és 14 jellegzetes ovális ablakkal készül, miközben a 100 %-osan friss levegőt biztosító légkondícionáló rendszer az utastérben legfeljebb 6000 láb magasságnak megfelelő légnyomást biztosít, ami csökkenti az utazással járó és az időzóna eltérésből eredő fáradtság hatásait. Összességében a G550-nel a Gulfstream listavezető üzleti gépet hozott létre, amely nemcsak messzebbre és nagyobb sebességgel tudja szállítani utasait, hanem garantálja, hogy felfrissülten érkezzenek meg a célállomásra.",

A felhajtóerő növelése és a légellenállás csökkentése érdekében 7 láb méretű szárnyvégeket szereltek a gépre és módosították az üzemanyagellátó rendszert egy rendkívül nagy teljesítményű repülőgépet hozva így létre.

A gép meredek megközelítésekre is minősítést kapott, így olyan repülőterekre is leszállhat, amelyek számos más gép számára nem elérhetőek.

A Phenom 300, a lenyűgöző, megszakítás nélküli 3600 kilométeres repülésével össze tudja kötni a legtöbb európai várost, mindezt rendkívül versenyképes árakon. A Phenom, a magas hőmérsékletű környezetben és magasan fekvő reptereken mutatott teljesítménye szintén megkülönbözteti versenytársaitól, túlszárnyalva az elvárásokat, megőrizve rendkívüli üzemanyag hatékonyságát, amellyel nemcsak üzemeltetési költségét, hanem ökológiai lábnyomát is csökkenti.

Az Embraer csaknem 3 ezer kilométeres hatótávolságú és alapkialakításában akár 50 utas befogadására alkalmas utasterű ERJ 145 modellje tökéletesen alkalmas kisebb csoportok rövidebb távolságú szállítására, és különösen jó megoldás például sportegyesületek csapatai vagy esküvői társaságok privát utazásainak lebonyolítására. A sugárhajtású ERJ 145 jelentősen nagyobb utazási sebességre képes, mint a turbólégcsavaros gépek, (például a Fokker 50-es modell) továbbá sokkal csendesebb utazást tesz lehetővé jelentősen nagyobb távolságokon. Ez a gép összességében kiválóan alkalmas olyan nagyobb csoportok kiszolgálására, akik hatékony és kényelmes eszközt keresnek magánutazásaikhoz. ",

Az innováció digitalizálni fogja a repülőgép működését, csökkenti a pilótákra nehezedő munka mennyiségét, valamint növeli a repülőgép teljesítményét és megbízhatóságát. Így megjósolható, ezzel a Legacy 450 lesz a legnagyobb teljesítményű, üzleti+ kategóriás repülőgép a piacon, amely nagyobb hatótávolságot és jobb üzemanyag-hatékonyságot nyújtva a Cessna és a Bombardier versenytársaknál egyaránt. E képességein túl ez a sugárhajtású repülőgép osztálya legnagyobb utasterét mondhatja majd magáénak, 7 utasnak kínál maximális kényelmet nyújtó ülőhelyet, emellett 4 köbméter csomagtér is rendelkezésre áll majd, ami példaértékű ebben a kategóriában. A Legacy 450-t már sokan megrendelték, ezért várhatóan teljesíteni fogja az Embraer ígéreteit és kivételes szolgáltatást nyújt majd rövid- és középtávú repülőutakon.",

A csomagok mennyisége nem okozhat gondot, hiszen a  fő kabin több mint 9 köbméter tároló helyet kínál, míg további csomagok a több mint 3 köbméteres külső tárolókban kaphatnak helyet. A Lineage 1000 nemcsak rendkívül tágas, hanem nagyon kényelmes is, mivel a legkorszerűbb stabilizátorokkal rendelkezik és turbulencia észlelő technológiája garantálja a sima repülést. Ezen túlmenően a két sugárhajtómű több mint 8000 kilométer hatótávolságot biztosít ennek a VIP repülőgépnek, könnyedén alkalmassá téve transzkontinentális repülésekre. Mindent figyelembe véve a Lineage 1000-rel az Embraer egy olyan repülőgépet hozott létre, amely figyelemreméltó üzemelési paraméterei megtartása mellett tágas utasterében a legfényűzőbb utazást biztosítja.",

A G350-nek ezért a G450-nel megegyező hasznos teher alapterülete van, de a kisebb hatótávolságnak köszönhetően alacsonyabb az ára. A leszállás nélkül megtehető 7000 kilométeres hatótávval a G350-es így is alkalmas interkontinentális utak megtételére, ráadásul mind a Challenger 605-ös, mind a Legacy 600-as sebességét meghaladó rendkívül nagy sebességgel képes haladni. A tágas 12 utasülést és konyhát is magában foglaló utasteret a jellegzetes Gulfstream ablakok világítják be. A típus egyik jelelmzője a más repülőgép típusoknál magasabb utaskabin légnyomás, mely sokkal kellemesebb utazási környezetet eredményez, így az utasok felfrissülve érkezhetnek meg célállomásukra. Gyors, tágas és kényelmes; a G350 kiváló megoldás közepes távú, (3-6 órás) repülések megvalósításra.",

In spite of its age, the GII&rsquo;s performance still rivals that of many much more recent aircraft, offering a greater range than the Dassault Falcon 2000 and equalling Bombardier&rsquo;s Challenger 605 in terms of maximum cruise speed. The GII features a large and spacious stand-up cabin that comfortably accommodates 12 passengers in its typical executive seating configuration. Through its combination of comfort and performance, it is evident how the GII laid the foundations on which Gulfstream built its highly successful fleet of Large, Super Large and Long-Range Business Jets.",

      "description": "Gulfstream introduced the 3rd member of the successful Gulfstream family, the GIII, in 1980 as an upgraded version of the GII and belonging to the same category of Large Jets. The GIII offers a largely improved performance thanks to an overall redesign, including the increase of the length of the wings and the addition of 5-foot winglets, serving to reduce drag and increase efficiency. Consequently, the GIII achieves a significantly greater range than its predecessor, while maintaining the exceptional reliability for which Gulfstream aircraft are renowned. The GIII features an extremely spacious stand-up cabin, that typically caters to 12-14 passengers in its executive seating configuration but certain variations can accommodate up to 19. Excelling in every department, from comfort to performance, the GIII is a first-rate business jet that is still capable of providing an excellent service.",

Bár a Bombardier állítása szerint a Global 7000 és 8000 - ha majd szolgálatba lép - túl fog tenni rajta, jelenleg a G550 a G650  rendelkezik a legnagyobb hatótávolsággal a piacon, mivel egyhuzamban képes akár 12,500 kilométert is megtenni. Kiváló maximális utazósebességének köszönhetően így tudja nagyszerű időn belül összekötni New York-ot Doha-val, Párizst Szingapúrral vagy Shanghai-t Genf-fel . Ezt a sugárhajtású repülőgépet nemcsak nagy teljesítményéért illeti dicséret, hanem tágas belső teréért is, amely 3 egymástól elválasztott kabinszekcióra van osztva és 14 utast képes elhelyezni a legnagyobb kényelemben. A csendes és világos belső tér érdekében a repülőgép az elérhető legkorszerűbb zajcsökkentő technológiával és 14 jellegzetes ovális ablakkal készül, miközben a 100 %-osan friss levegőt biztosító légkondícionáló rendszer az utastérben legfeljebb 6000 láb magasságnak megfelelő légnyomást biztosít, ami csökkenti az utazással járó és az időzóna eltérésből eredő fáradtság hatásait. Összességében a G550-nel a Gulfstream listavezető üzleti gépet hozott létre, amely nemcsak messzebbre és nagyobb sebességgel tudja szállítani utasait, hanem garantálja, hogy felfrissülten érkezzenek meg a célállomásra.",

Hihetetlen maximális utazósebességével a G650 a leggyorsabb nagy hatótávú üzleti repülőgép a piacon, sebessége csaknem eléri a hangét és két kitűnő hatékony Rolls-Royce BR725 hajtómű szolgáltatja ehhez a tolóerőt. Így gyorsabban és messzebbre repül, mint bármely más sugárhajtású repülőgép a kategóriájában és ultra nagyméretű utasterének köszönhetően mindezt a legnagyobb kényelmet nyújtva teszi. Fényűző dönthető foteleiben és díványain három egymástól elválasztott térben biztosítanak kényelmes elhelyezést 13 utas számára. A G650-et ellátták a legkorszerűbb technológiával a szórakoztatás és a nagy teljesítmény érdekében s egyúttal a legújabb turbulencia érzékelő és zajcsökkentő rendszerek gondoskodnak a csendes, egyenletes és pihentető utazásról. Csakúgy mint a G550-ben, a Gulfstreamnek sikerült az utasok megterhelését csökkenteni a 100%-osan friss levegőt adó szellőztető rendszerrel és az utastér maximum 6000 láb magasságnak megfelelő légnyomásával.

      "description": "A Gulfstream 2001-ben indította el a G200 gyártósorát és azóta számos külső és belső módosítást, fejlesztést hajtott végre rajta. Az eredmény egy rendkívül népszerű repülőgép lett, az első az úgynevezett \"új generációs\" prémium+ (super-midsize) üzleti sugárhajtásúak között. 2001 és 2011 között - amely idő alatt több mint 150 darabot szállítottak le - a repülőgép típus 99,75%.-os biztonsággal volt igénybevehető. A G200 fényűző belső tere vetekszik a Challenger 300-as belső terének méretével és eltörpülnek mellette a Falcon 50, vagy a Citation X hasonló adatai, a Challenger 300-zal ellentétben viszont a típus nem áldozza fel az elérhető legnagyobb sebességet az utastér méretének csökkentése érdekében. A G200 nemcsak gyors, hanem nagyobb hatótávolságot is kínál versenytársainál, így olyan utakat is képes megtenni, mint Genf - Dubai. A tágas kabin 9 főre tipikus üléselrendezést kínál, WIFI szolgáltatással és egy hátsó konyhával. Mindent figyelembe véve a G200 megalkuvás nélkül kombinálja a teljesítményt a kényelemmel bármely közép távú útvonalon kiváló szolgáltatást nyújtva.",

      "description": "A Gulfstream, a sorozatban rendhagyónak tűnő G280-ra nevezte át a korábbi G250-et. Ennek oka, hogy a kínai kultúrkörben a 250-es szám negatív értelmű és az amerikai gyártó demonstrálni kívánta idegen kultúrák iránti érzékenységét és azt, hogy milyen nagyra értékeli nemzetközi ügyfeleit. A névtől függetlenül ez a prémium+ kategóriájú (super-midsize) magánrepülőgép 2012-es bevezetését követően világszerte felkeltette a figyelmet hihetetlen teljesítményével. Több mint 6600 kilométeres hatótávolsága kiváló, nagyobb mint a Cessna, Bombardier és Hawker versenytársainak hasonló adata. Rendkívül gyors, több, útvonalrekordot is felállított. A Gulfstream szerint üzemanyag hatékonysága a legjobb a kategóriájában és kihívást jelentene ennél kényelmesebb utasteret találni. A G280 belső tere - amelyben 9 utas utazhat egymással szembeni (Club 4) elrendezésben háromüléses kanapéval és további 2 egyéni üléssel - nemcsak nagyobb és tágasabb versenytársainál, hanem a legkorszerűbb technológiával csendes környezetet is biztosít. A G280 valóban a stílus és tartalom tökéletes kombinációját képviseli, és az osztálya repülőgépei által kínált legtökéletesebb szolgáltatást nyújtja.",

Az XP, mint továbbfejlesztett Hawker 400-as megnövekedett teljesítményt képvisel, úgy mint megnövekedett hatótáv, nagyobb utazási sebesség, hatékonyabb üzemanyag-fogyasztás. A 400XP mindig is népszerű volt az amerikai piacon és 2010-es bevezetését követően Európában is rendkívül jó fogadtatásban részesült. Ez a népszerűség nagymértékben különleges belsőterének köszönhető, amely a Cessna Citation CJ1, 2 és 3-nék hosszabb és szélesebb kabint jelent, amely 6 utas elhelyezésére alkalmas: szemközti üléseken (Club 4) és további 3 egyéni ülés elrendezésben.

Bár a Premier 1A könnyű kategóriájába tartozik, utasterének szélessége és magassága valójában nagyobb, mint néhány nagyobb üzleti+ besorolásúé, mint pl. a Learjet 45XR. Következésképpen a Premier 1A egy rendkívül tágas sugárhajtású repülő, amely kényelmes elhelyezést biztosít 6 utas számára, egymással szemben (Club 4) és további 2 egyéni ülés elrendezésben. Premier 1A kivételesen tágas belső terét nagy részben a kompozit géptörzsnek köszönheti, mely egyben elég jó hatótávolságot és jó maximális utazósebességet tesz lehetővé.

Az eredmény lenyűgöző tekintve, hogy a 850XP nagy hatótávolságot és csúcssebességet kínál rendkívüli hatékonyság mellett. A repülőgép sikere kivételes belső terének is köszönhető.

      "description": "A Honda a HondaJet-et a \"világ legfejlettebb üzleti légitaxi (very light business ) sugárhajtású repülőgépeként\" jellemzi, jó okkal. A HondaJet első repülésére 2014. július 1-én került sor, mely időpontig a jelentések szerint a repülőgép már több mint 100 megrendelést kapott. Kategóriája legnagyobb tagjaként a HondaJet 5 utast tud elhelyezni tágas utasterében kényelmes rövidtávú utazást nyújtva. Innovatív tervezése fejlett technológiákat és koncepciókat használ egy olyan repülőgép létrehozására, amely nemcsak szemet gyönyörködtető, hanem egyben osztálya leggyorsabb és leginkább üzemanyag hatékony példánya, ami részben a szárny fölé szerelt hajtóműveknek köszönhető. A Honda azt ígéri, hogy nagyon könnyű kategóriás repülőgépe túl fogja szárnyalni versenytársai modelljeinek hatótávolságát is, és minden bizonnyal képes lesz olyan Európán belüli útvonalak megtételére, mint például Párizs - Ibiza vagy Genf - Berlin.",

Számos külső és belső módosítást hajtottak végre rajta, bár megőrizte a Hawker tágas utasterét, amely kiemelkedően széles és magas egy könnyű kategóriájú géphez képest. A belső terét úgy alakították át, hogy 400XT legyen osztályában a legcsendesebb az új akusztikus szigetelési megoldásának köszönhetően, miközben elődjéhez hasonlóan továbbra is kényelmes elhelyezést biztosít 6 utas számára, egymással szembeni (Club 4), és további 2 egyéni ülés elrendezésben. Külsőleg a 400XT korszerűsítései aerodinamikai fejlesztéseket, javított hajtómű felfüggesztést és modernebb iker turbóhajtóműveket tartalmaztak. Ennek következtében a 400XT hatótávolsága kiváló, a repülőgép rendkívül gyors és hatékony, így működési költségei alacsonyak. Összességében, a Nextant-nak sikerült a Hawker közismerten osztályában első utasterét kivételes teljesítménnyel párosítani, s ezzel egy olyan könnyű sugárhajtású repülőgépet alkotni, mely tökéletes üzleti utakra vagy hétvégi kirándulásokra.",

Az Avantinak nemcsak a stílusa gyakorol ránk mély benyomást, hanem rendkívül nagy teljesítménye is, amelynek köszönhetően sokkal messzebbre és gyorsabban képes repülni, mint kategóriájának sugárhajtású repülőgépei. Sebessége és hatótávolsága valójában olyan nagy, hogy megállja a versenyt sok, üzleti (light business jet) kategóriába tartozó sugárhajtású repülőgéppel összehasonlítva is, üzemanyag hatékonysága pedig a legtöbb üzleti sugárhajtású repülőgépénél közel 40 százalékkal jobb. Belseje is egy más, drágább kategóriájú sugárhajtású repülőgépére hasonlít, csendes utastere pedig szélesebb és magasabb, mint a Cessna CJ sorozatának bármely modelljéé. Az Avanti II páratlanul nagy teljesítményű és kényelmes, ár-érték aránya egyenesen fantasztikus.",

A Saab 340 teljesítményjellemzői hasonlatosak a Dornier 328 Turboprop modelléihez, mérete is hasonló, gazdaságos elrendezésben akár 33 személyt is képes befogadni, a változtatható üléselrendezés révén azonban egyes gépek 34, vagy 36 ülőhellyel rendelkeznek. Mint turbólégcsavaros repülőgép, a Saab 340 korlátozott hatótávolsággal rendelkezik, ezért csak rövid utakra alkalmas.  A jelentős férőhely és a kiváló ár révén a Saab 340 nagyszerű megoldás a rövidebb távú légiutakra. ",

      "description": "La gama King Air entró en servicio hace más de 45 años y desde entonces ha sido conocida por su durabilidad, fiabilidad y accesibilidad. Después de la serie de mejoras de los últimos años, el King Air 90 GTx se puso en marcha en julio de 2009.Fue diseñado para reemplazar al C90GTi. La incorporación de elegantes winglets mejora la subida y la velocidad de crucero, y logra impulsar la eficiencia y el rendimiento de combustible. Su alcance se ha incrementado en más de un 20%, lo que le lleva aún más lejos que antes, 1.060 km a alta velocidad con cuatro adultos a bordo. Aunque es el más pequeño de la gama King Air, puede acomodar hasta 5 pasajeros. La cabina cuenta con aviónica y un sistema de detección de turbulencias de alta gama, que por lo general se encuentra en aviones más grandes con precios aún mayores. Otro añadido a este excelente avión de turbohélice es su capacidad para aterrizar donde otros muchos aviones no pueden. En general, este pequeño avión está repleto de características de aviones más grandes y ofrece una excelente eficiencia de combustible y alcance. ",

Hasta que se suspendió la producción en 2005, se vendieron más de 800 aviones. Su cabina extra-ancha del Challenger 604 fue en parte responsable de la enorme popularidad de este avión, ya que era más amplia que la de cualquier otro avión de su categoría. Esto explica la comodidad que experimentamos durante el vuelo ya que el ambiente interior es hogareño y se adapta fácilmente a 9 pasajeros en 2 zonas separadas. El 604 también ofrece un excelente alcance de casi 7.500 kilómetros, por lo que es capaz de emprender viajes de París a Moscú o de Los Ángeles a Nueva York y, con una alta velocidad de crucero, puede hacerlo en un tiempo récord.

      "description": "El 850 se convirtió en buque insignia de la gama Challenger de Bombardier, cuando esta empresa se dio cuenta de que su serie de aviones de largo alcance, «Global», se utilizaba con frecuencia para trayectos más cortos. En consecuencia, se puso en marcha el Challenger 850, basado en el avión regional de Canadair, para proporcionar la espaciosa cabina de un Global 6000, pero sin su capacidad de alcance, logrando así una reducción del coste. El 850 sigue teniendo capacidades transcontinentales pero es ideal para viajes de media distancia y ofrece un interior muy cómodo, ya que la gran cabina cuenta con 3 zonas de estar independientes, equipadas con la última tecnología de reducción de ruido para asegurar un viaje tranquilo. Además de la comodidad, el 850 ofrece un rendimiento excelente, ya que no sólo es rápido, sino también eficiente. ",

Estas ventajas permiten hacer vuelos directos desde Cannes a Budapest en sólo una hora y media o desde Ibiza a Londres en sólo una hora y 45 minutos, dependiendo de las condiciones. La altura de la cabina es menor que la del Learjet 60XR pero puede acomodar fácilmente a 8 pasajeros en una configuración de doble Club 4. Debido a su capacidad de vuelo a gran altitud y a la tecnología de estabilización, se garantiza un vuelo suave, directo y eficiente.

La disposición típica es Club 4, un sofá de tres plazas y dos asientos individuales, lo que permite a 9 pasajeros viajar con una comodidad óptima. Además de este confortable interior, el 300 también ofrece un servicio excelente, debido a su alta capacidad de rendimiento. Ofrece un alcance competitivo de más de 5.700 kilómetros, por lo que es capaz de conectar Cannes y Dubai, por ejemplo. Muy espaciosa y fiable, el Challenger 300 es muy recomendable para vuelos de media distancia. ",

      "description": "El primer modelo de Cessna del Citation CJ4 voló en mayo de 2009, con la primera entrega al año siguiente. Es el miembro más nuevo y más grande de la familia CJ y ha ganado gran popularidad rápidamente, sobre todo en Europa. Esto es en parte debido al excelente interior del CJ4 que, alargado hasta 5.29m, es más espacioso que el resto de aviones de la gama CJ, capaz de alojar hasta 7 pasajeros. Con un alcance de más de 3.700 kilómetros y una velocidad máxima de 839 kmh, el CJ4 es uno de los aviones ligeros de más alto rendimiento en el mercado. También ofrece grandes capacidades de despegue y de aterrizaje, lo que le permite acceder a aeropuertos con pistas cortas, como Lugano o St Tropez, que a menudo son más convenientes. El sistema de radar meteorológico de vanguardia permite detectar tiempo potencialmente perturbador con mucha antelación y, por lo tanto, evitar turbulencias, garantizando un vuelo más suave. El CJ4 ofrece un servicio impresionante, consiguiendo llegar a su destino con gran comodidad y en tiempo récord. ",

También posee una impresionante velocidad máxima de crucero, lo que le permite viajar más rápido y más lejos que el CJ1+. El interior del M2 tiene capacidad para 5 pasajeros en una disposición Club 4 y un asiento adicional frente a la puerta de la cabina. Tiene un nuevo diseño moderno, más cómodo y espacioso.

Con un alcance de más de 5.600 kilómetros, el Citation X es capaz de viajes intercontinentales o sin escalas desde Dubai a Niza, por ejemplo. Este excelente resultado se debe a los motores turbo dobles de gran tamaño de Rolls-Royce y a las características de diseño inteligente de la aeronave, como el ala perfilada fácilmente reconocible y los winglets. Elegante y moderno, el interior del Citation X ofrece todas las comodidades que esperamos encontrar en el interior de un avión de negocios de última generación. Hasta 8 pasajeros caben dentro de la espaciosa cabina que cuenta con dos modalidades Club 4 para ofrecer un viaje cómodo. De esta manera, el Citation X hace gala de un rendimiento excepcional y una experiencia de vuelo agradable y relajante. ",

Cessna creía que habían encontrado un hueco en la industria de los vuelos privados y el éxito del Mustang así lo demostró. Desde 2005 se han fabricado más de 350 de estos aviones extremadamente populares. Embraer y Honda reaccionaron a esto y lanzaron un VLJ rival. Aunque estos son ligeramente más grandes que el Mustang, su cabina es muy cómoda y con capacidad para 4 pasajeros. Además, este avión ofrece una excelente relación calidad-precio, siendo con frecuencia el avión más asequible del mercado. A menudo supera a aviones de turbo-hélice en precio. A fin de cuentas, el Mustang es perfectamente adecuado para vuelos de corta distancia dentro de Europa, vuelos de negocios con ida y vuelta en el mismo día y excursiones de fin de semana. ",

      "description": "El Falcon 2000EX entró en servicio en 2003 como una versión actualizada del Falcon 2000, al tiempo que pertenece a la misma categoría que los grandes reactores comerciales. Cuenta con un interior más cómodo y moderno que ofrece capacidad para hasta 10 pasajeros, lo que mejora la experiencia general de vuelo. La actualización más importante, además de la comodidad de la cabina, fueron los nuevos motores del ventilador turbo y dobles con los que se ha equipado el EX. Estos permiten al EX viajar más lejos y más rápido que su predecesor, así como ayudar a alcanzar una altitud de crucero superior. Esto reduce considerablemente el tiempo total de viaje, ya que el 2000EX es capaz de volar por encima del tráfico aéreo comercial y tomar el camino más directo posible. Esta mayor altitud de crucero también significa que el EX es capaz de evitar el clima potencialmente perjudicial, lo que contribuye a garantizar un viaje suave y confortable. ",

En primer lugar, los motores mejorados dan a la aeronave mayor alcance, de casi 7.500 kilómetros, y un aumento de la velocidad de crucero máxima. En segundo lugar, el LX tiene nuevas alas, diseñadas para reducir la resistencia hasta un 5%, haciéndolo mucho más eficiente que su predecesor y, de hecho, que cualquier otro avión de su categoría de grandes aviones comerciales. En tercer lugar, siendo un avión más reciente significa que el LX ofrece un interior mucho más moderno, equipado con un sistema vanguardista de entretenimiento, tecnología de reducción de ruido y asientos más cómodos para hasta 10 pasajeros. A fin de cuentas, Dassault ha actualizado todas las áreas del 2000EX para crear el Falcon 2000LX, un avión de empresa muy eficiente y cómodo, para proporcionar un servicio excepcional ya sea en viajes por negocios o por placer.",

Al igual que el LX, el 2000S ofrece una amplia cabina de pie, capaz de alojar hasta 10 pasajeros en una disposición Club 4 y 6 asientos individuales. La principal diferencia entre ellos es el excepcional rendimiento a baja velocidad del 2000S, gracias al que este avión tiene la huella más verde de toda la serie Falcon de Dassault. Este rendimiento a baja velocidad también reduce la distancia de aterrizaje del 2000S a 705 metros, lo que significa que este tiene acceso a un 50% más aeródromos que otros aviones de su clase, y le permite llegar a pistas de aterrizaje más remotas que a menudo están más cerca de su final destino.",

Mejoras en el motor, mejoras aerodinámicas y un aumento de la capacidad de combustible dan al 8X un alcance increíble, considerablemente mayor que el del 7X, e incluso mayor que el del Global 6000 de Bombardier. Esto permitirá que el Falcon 8X vuele desde París a Singapur y desde Nueva York a Pekín, a una velocidad de crucero alta, para que llegue a su destino en el tiempo establecido. El avión está equipado con tecnología de última generación, dotándolo de una impresionante eficiencia de combustible, así como de detección meteorológica y sistemas de estabilización para asegurar un viaje sin problemas. La espaciosa cabina es más larga que la del Falcon 7X, alojando hasta 15 pasajeros en un vuelo aún más cómodo y agradable en cualquiera de su amplia variedad de configuraciones de asientos disponibles.

También contará con un interior elegante y moderno, incluyendo la primera ventana tragaluz de techo en un avión corporativo, así como un sistema de entretenimiento de última generación y tecnología de estabilización para asegurar un vuelo tranquilo y agradable. Hasta 14 pasajeros podrán viajar en este lujoso avión, que también promete un rendimiento impresionante, un alcance máximo y una velocidad de crucero que compite y a menudo superan las de los aviones súper grandes.

Con un volumen de la cabina de 9,2m3, el Phenom 300 tiene un interior más espacioso que sus dos competidores Hawker y Cessna, con capacidad para 7 pasajeros. Fue diseñado por una empresa conjunta entre BMW y Design Works para garantizar el máximo confort, haciendo que este avión ligero parezca mucho más grande que otros de su categoría. Además de su interior más cómodo, el Phenom ofrece un alcance mayor que sus rivales. Capaz de unos impresionantes 3.600 kilómetros de vuelo ininterrumpido, el Phenom 300 puede conectar la mayoría de ciudades europeas a precios muy competitivos. El rendimiento en pista del Phenom también lo diferencia del resto, ya que supera las expectativas al aterrizar a altas temperaturas y a altas elevaciones, manteniendo gran eficiencia de combustible, que disminuye su coste de operación, así como su huella.",

También es el primer avión de tamaño mediano con tecnología «fly-by-wire» completa, proporcionando mayor confort, eficiencia y estabilidad. Embraer diseñó el 500 con un objetivo: convertirse en el líder de su clase. En cuanto a su interior, el Legacy 500 ofrece una cabina más ancha y larga que cualquier otro avión de tamaño mediano existente. Lo que proporciona un espacio y comodidad sin precedentes. Diseñado por BMW, la cabina cuenta con asientos para un máximo de 8 pasajeros y asientos premium con soporte lumbar eléctrico y sistemas de masaje y de calefacción, nunca vistos en ningún otro avión de esta categoría. El Legacy 500 no compromete el rendimiento de su cabina de lujo, ya que ofrece un excelente alcance y velocidad máxima de crucero, gracias a sus dos motores turbofán de última generación, que son más eficientes en combustible que los de la mayoría de sus rivales. Rápido, eficaz y cómodo, el Legacy 500 ofrece un servicio excepcional.",

Por tanto, el G350 tiene el mismo espacio en el suelo que el G450, pero debido a que su alcance es menor que el del G450, está disponible a un precio menor. Con la capacidad de volar sin interrupción durante más de 7.000 kilómetros, el G350 es capaz de realizar vuelos intercontinentales y también es extremadamente rápido, más que el Challenger 605 y que el Legacy 600. Las ventanas de la marca Gulfstream iluminan la espaciosa cabina, equipada con capacidad para hasta 12 pasajeros, así como con una cocina completa. El G350 también cuenta con una zona de baja presurización para reducir la fatiga del viaje y asegurar que los pasajeros lleguen a su destino renovados. Rápido, amplio y cómodo, el G350 es una excelente solución a sus necesidades de vuelos de medio recorrido.  ",

Aunque Bombardier afirma que el Global 7000 y el 8000, una vez estén en servicio, serán superiores a éste, a día de hoy el G550, junto con el G650, tienen el mayor alcance de la industria, capaces de recorrer más de 12.500 kilómetros de vuelo sin escalas. Por lo tanto, puede conectar Nueva York con Doha, París con Singapur o Shanghái con Ginebra y, con una excelente velocidad de crucero máxima, puede hacerlo en un tiempo récord. Este avión no sólo es alabado por su alto rendimiento, sino también por su amplio espacio interior, que cuenta con 3 zonas de estar independientes con capacidad hasta 14 pasajeros en la máxima comodidad. Está equipado con la tecnología de reducción de ruido más moderna y 14 ventanas ovaladas para garantizar una cabina silenciosa y luminosa. Además, el sistema de aire fresco al 100% y la máxima altitud de cabina de 6.000 pies reducen los efectos de fatiga del viaje y el jet lag. En general, en el G550, Gulfstream ha creado un avión de alta gama, capaz no sólo de llegar a un destino aún más lejano a una velocidad superior, sino también de garantizar que llegue descansado.",

Dejando el nombre a un lado, este avión de tamaño medio ha capturado la atención mundial desde su lanzamiento en el año 2012 por su increíble rendimiento. Cuenta con un excelente alcance de más de 6.600 kilómetros, mayor que el de sus competidores Cessna, Bombardier y Hawker y es extremadamente rápido. Gulfstream cree que también tiene la mejor eficiencia de combustible en su categoría y desafía a sus competidores a encontrar una cabina más cómoda. El interior del G280 no sólo es más grande y más amplio que sus competidores, con capacidad para 9 pasajeros en una formación Club 4, un sofá de tres plazas y dos asientos adicionales, sino que también ofrece una tecnología de última generación para crear un entorno de cabina silencioso. El G280 representa una combinación perfecta de estilo y diseño y ofrece el servicio más completo entre los aviones de su clase. ",

      "description": "El Piaggio Avanti II fue lanzado en 2004 como sucesor del Avanti y se clasifica como avión de turbohélice. Su diseño italiano es completamente único, a diferencia de cualquier otro avión en el mercado, por lo que es extremadamente popular. El Avanti no sólo impresiona por su estilo, sino que tiene un rendimiento muy alto y viaja mucho más lejos y más rápido que cualquier otro avión en su categoría. De hecho, su velocidad y alcance son tan grandes que rivalizan con algunos aviones ligeros. Su eficiencia de combustible es casi un 40% mayor que la mayoría de aviones de negocios. El interior, con capacidad para 7 pasajeros, también se asemeja a un avión de una categoría superior, gracias a su cabina silenciosa. Es más ancho y más alto que cualquiera de la gama Cessna CJ. Esta combinación de alto rendimiento y comodidad, algo inaudito en un avión de esta clase, significa que el Avanti II es también una fantástica relación calidad-precio. ",

      "description": "El PC-24 es un bimotor ligero actualmente en desarrollo por el fabricante suizo Pilatus y con previsión de certificación para 2017. El PC-24 fue concebido gracias a los comentarios de los pasajeros que querían conservar las capacidades de pista corta de los aviones más pequeños, y mantener un gran alcance y velocidad. \n\nPilatus afirma que el PC-24 será único gracias a sus excepcionales distancias de aterrizaje y despegue. Puede utilizar pistas sin pavimentar y franjas de hierba de despegue y aterrizaje, dando acceso a más de 21.000 pistas de aterrizaje que otros aviones no pueden utilizar (en operaciones privadas sólo no es posible en vuelo chárter debido a las regulaciones comerciales). También tendrá un alcance impresionante, similar al del Phenom 300 y al del CJ4.\n\nCon un alto rendimiento, el PC-24 se compromete a proporcionar el espacio interior y el confort de un avión de tamaño mediano por el precio de un avión ligero. Contará con la cabina más larga y ancha entre los aviones de su categoría, además de ofrecer el mayor espacio para el equipaje, accesible a través de su gran puerta de carga. \n\nCon ya muchos pedidos para el PC-24, está claro que Pilatus ha logrado convencer a la industria de que su avión ligero más reciente ofrecerá a los pasajeros un equilibrio perfecto entre rendimiento y comodidad.\n",

El Saab 340 ofrece un rendimiento similar al del Dornier 328 Turbohélice y también tiene un tamaño similar, con capacidad para 33 pasajeros en una configuración estándar, aunque existen variaciones a esta formación, con algunos aviones de 34 o 36 asientos. Siendo un avión de turbohélice, el Saab 340 tiene un alcance limitado, restringiéndolo a vuelos de corta distancia. Con una gran capacidad y excelente precio, el Saab 340 representa una gran solución a las necesidades de viajes de corta distancia. ",
